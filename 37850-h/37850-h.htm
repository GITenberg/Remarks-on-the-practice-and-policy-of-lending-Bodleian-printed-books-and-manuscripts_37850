<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The present 'Remarks' are a reprint, with many
omissions and additions, of two privately printed
papers which were communicated to the Curators
last year. From November, 1884, for about twelve
months, I did very little more than watch attentively
the way in which Bodleian business is
transacted, to me at once a novelty and a surprise.
For some purposes writing is preferable
to talking, and accordingly in November, 1885,
I printed a memorandum containing many gentle
hints&mdash;<span title="ph&ocirc;nanta sunetoisin">&#966;&#969;&#957;&#8118;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span>&mdash;which I faintly hoped
might eventually prove beneficial to the Library.
Next came a Memorandum 'on the Classed Catalogue,'
a thing which some Curators look on as a
most valuable work, and others as an interminable
and wasteful absurdity. This was followed by a
paper 'on the Bodleian Coins and Medals', with
some observations on the proposal to transfer the
collection to the Ashmolean Museum. As far as
could be seen, all this expenditure of ink and
money did no harm, and no good. In May, 1886,
a committee was appointed to draw up regulations
for loans of books; and in June the Curators received
a paper 'on the lending of Bodleian Books
and Manuscripts,' as also Bishop Barlow's Argument
against lending them, then for the first time<span class="pagenum">[iv]</span>
printed as a whole; and in both the illegality of
the borrowers' list was pointed out, and very
broad hints given, not only that the present loan
statute is defective, but why, and in what manner
it is so. If these hints, facts, and arguments had
been addressed to the twelve signs of the Zodiac,
they could not have produced less visible effect;
and it was wonderfully amusing to find, that more
than half my brethren could not for the life of
them see what to everybody else was plain as a
pikestaff; so on we went in the well-beaten path,
steady as old Time himself, looking neither to
the right hand nor to the left, and, what is more
remarkable, never for one moment looking ahead.
Finally, at the beginning of October, came a paper
on 'Book-lending as practised at the Bodleian';
and this proved to be the last straw; for on
October 30th, partly by words and partly by that
silence which gives consent, it was plainly intimated
that these papers were unwelcome. One
friend, and only one, had a good word to say for
them; so far as they contained collection of facts
he approved of them, but no further. As my little
experiment failed so lamentably, I am hardly likely
to repeat it, or to put so severe a strain on the good
nature and patience of my colleagues as ever again
to trouble them with a scrap of printed paper.
This puts me into a sort of quandary. I abhor
pen and ink, and should like to hold my tongue
and spare my pocket; but that is impossible as
things are. I cannot stand by and see men who<span class="pagenum">[v]</span>
know no better trying (with the best possible intentions)
to get the Bodleian on to an inclined
plane, down which it must rapidly slide to perdition,
without loudly protesting against their acts.
What then is to be done? Private feelings must
be respected, yet not so as to impede the performance
of a duty to the Library and to the
University. The atmosphere of a meeting is not
conducive to calm and rational discussion; I cannot
make speeches; the board does not relish
either facts or arguments in print. Only one
course remains then; whenever there is anything
to be said about the Bodleian or its management
(and there is much that ought to be, and must
be said sooner or later), it shall no longer be
privately printed and given away to unwilling
recipients, but published and sold. In this way
all parties will be satisfied: those who are interested
in the Library can buy; those who are not, can
protect themselves against annoyance. So much
by way of explanation.</p>

<p>When at length the board determined to apply
for a new statute, and did in November what anybody
but ourselves would have done in June, the
hope was expressed that the statute would be
introduced at once, and then pushed through
Congregation and Convocation as rapidly as possible
in the present term; whereupon somebody
observed, that it would be just as well not to
hurry the business; and this seems to have been
the view adopted by Council.<span class="pagenum">[vi]</span></p>

<p>If Convocation could only seize the full significance
and incalculable value to present and future
generations of a library of reference, a library, that
is, where, at all lawful times, every book deposited
in it should always be forthcoming in a moment,
it would at once see that from such a library no
lending whatever ought to be permitted, simply
because lending and deposit are practical contradictories;
and if Convocation could plainly see
this, it would make very short work of any statute
which legalized loans. There is no denying, however,
that in the present day the public mind, as
it is playfully called, and the University mind as
well, is in a wonderfully flabby condition. Nobody
seems to be thoroughly convinced of the unquestionable
truth, that every possible plan in this
world is open to objections more or less serious,
and so they go hunting about for a scheme that
shall embrace all good and exclude all evil; such
people are emphatically limp and unpractical. All
that is offered to our choice here below is a
lesser evil, and experience has proved over and
over again, that it is a lesser evil never to lend
a book out of such a library as the Bodleian, than
it is to lend one. But if the University in its
inscrutable wisdom should choose to do the wrong
thing, there are more ways than one of doing it,&mdash;</p>

<p><span title="esthloi men gar hapl&ocirc;s, pantodap&ocirc;s de kakoi.">
&#7952;&#963;&#952;&#955;&#959;&#8054;
&#956;&#8050;&#957;
&#947;&#8048;&#961;
&#7937;&#960;&#955;&#8182;&#962;,
&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#948;&#945;&#960;&#8182;&#962;
&#948;&#8050;
&#954;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#8055;.</span>
</p>

<p>It might, for instance, confine the actual granting
of a loan to Convocation. If an application for
a book were made, the University might impose<span class="pagenum">[vii]</span>
on the Curators the duty of stating in writing their
reasons for advocating the loan, and Convocation
might determine to lend, if it judged those reasons
to be sound. This would be an approximation to
what was the law (though not by any means the
practice) prior to 1873; nor could it be described
as a retrograde step, unless the reformation of a
bad habit is necessarily a step backwards.</p>

<p>If, however, the University resolves to copy the
practice of foreign libraries, it might be wise, first,
to appoint a small committee to discover and report
what that practice really is. If, like a mob of
monkeys, we are determined to imitate, it is just as
well that our imitation should be a good one, and
not a caricature.</p>

<p>In either, or indeed in any, case some effectual
provision should be made for enforcing the statute;
it ought no longer to be possible for the Curators
to act with impunity as they have been in the habit
of acting for almost a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>A good many of my friends are strong party
men of a more or less rabid type, and I hope
that they are well informed when they tell me that
this purely literary question about the Bodleian is
not going to be turned into one of those faction
fights, which occasionally disturb and disgrace this
place; but that each man will judge for himself, and
vote accordingly, without divesting himself of what
little reason he may happen to possess, and blindly
following a leader, who may know and care less about
the matter than he does himself. I hope that it<span class="pagenum">[viii]</span>
will be so, yet I have my doubts; for this vile spirit
of faction clings like the robe of Nessus to all who
have ever been weak enough, or wicked enough,
to yield to its temptations; and one side is just
as bad as the other. Whether Convocation can be
got to see the real question in these unlearned and
vulgar times may be questionable; at any rate, I
should have felt myself a traitor to Bodley, to
Oxford, and to learning itself, if I had not done
what little I could to prevent an act, which, if perpetrated,
must end, sooner or later, in the irreparable
damage, or the complete destruction of a library
intended by its founder to be a perpetual help to
all true scholars, an inexhaustible treasure-house of
learning to last as long as England itself.</p>

<h2><i>Remarks on the Practice and Policy of lending
Bodleian Printed Books and Manuscripts.</i></h2>

<p>Before offering any remarks on the policy of lending
books out of the Bodleian Library it may be well to give
a brief account of the practice of lending, so far as it
has been sanctioned there. From the foundation of the
Library down to 1873, though practised, it cannot be said
to have been sanctioned at all, except as regards certain
books given on the condition that they should be lent.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June, 1610, a complete Bodleian Statute
was promulgated and confirmed in Convocation (Appendix
Statutorum, p. 5 sqq. ed. 1763). This statute was drawn
up by Sir Thomas Bodley himself, and the eighth section
of it&mdash;'de Libris extra Bibliothecam non ferendis, aut
ullo modo commodandis'&mdash;fully expresses his firm and
rooted detestation of book-lending. Bodley's own words,
of which the Latin statute is a literal translation, run
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And sith the sundry Examples of former Ages, as
well in this University, as in other Places of the Realm,
have taught us over-often, that the frequent Loan of
Books, hath bin a principal occasion of the Ruin and
Destruction of many famous Libraries; It is therefore
ordered and decreed to be observed as a Statute of irrevocable
Force, that for no Regard, Pretence, or Cause,
there shall at any time, any Volume, either of these
that are chained, or of others unchained, be given or lent,
to any Person or Persons, of whatsoever State or Calling,
upon any kind of Caution, or offer of Security, for his
faithful Restitution; and that no such Book or Volume
shall at any time, by any whatsoever, be carried forth
of the Library, for any longer space, or other uses, and<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
Purposes, than if need so require, to be sold away for
altogether, as being superfluous or unprofitable; or changed
for some other of a better Edition; or being over-worn
to be new bound again, and immediately returned, from
whence it was removed. For the Execution whereof
in every Particular, there shall no Man intermeddle, but
the Keeper himself alone, who is also to proceed with
the Knowledge, Liking, and Direction of those Publick
Overseers, whose Authority we will notify in other Statutes
ensuing<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Reliqui&aelig; Bodleian&aelig;, p. 27.</p></div>

<p>This statute has the great merit of being so plain and
clear, that no one could mistake its meaning. It was
further fenced about by the statute 'de materia indispensabili,'
Tit. X.&sect;11.5, as explained in 'Barlow's Argument,'
p. 6. It was not totally and absolutely impossible
to borrow a book from the Bodleian, but it was only
Convocation, moved to the act in a solemn and specified
way, that could by any legal means lend it. From 1610
to 1856, then, such was the law which everybody in the
University was bound to obey, and, as far as I can discover,
everybody did obey it, with the few exceptions that will
presently be mentioned.</p>

<p>In 1624 William, Bishop of Lincoln, wished to borrow
a book, but was denied<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. In 1628 Sir Thomas Roe gave
twenty-nine manuscripts, and "proposed that his books
should be permitted to be lent out for purposes of printing,
on proper security being given; a proposition which was
accepted by Convocation<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>." In 1629 the Earl of Pembroke
presented the Barocci Collection, and "he was willing
that the MSS. should, if necessary, be allowed to be
borrowed." Borrowed accordingly they were, and one
at least suffered irreparable injury in very early days<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.
In 1634 we were presented with Sir Kenelm Digby's
splendid manuscripts: "the donor stipulated that they
should not be strictly confined to use within the walls
<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>of the Library;" but afterwards left the University to
treat them as it pleased<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; so that they fell under the
general Bodleian Statute.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Barlow's Argument, p. 9.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Macray, Annals, p. 59.</p></div>

<p>Between 1635 and 1640 came Laud's magnificent donations.
He "directs in his letter of gift, that none
of the books shall on any account be taken out of the
Library 'nisi solum ut typis mandentur, et sic publici
et juris et utilitatis fiant,' upon sufficient security, to
be approved by the Vice-Chancellor and Proctors; the
MS. in such cases being immediately after printing restored
to its place in the Library<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>." This stipulation of Laud
should be carefully borne in mind, because it will be
found that of late years the Curators have not observed
the terms of the gift. Doubtless they did not know
what Laud's directions were; yet men who undertake
the office of trustees are bound to know their duties.
In 1636 the University refused leave to Laud himself,
who wished to borrow Rob. Hare's MS. <i>Liber Privilegiorum
Universitatis</i><a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. In 1645 Charles I, in ignorance of our
statutes, applied for a book and was refused; in 1654
Cromwell wanted a book for the Portuguese Ambassador,
and was likewise refused<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>; and it is much to the credit
of both, that they not only acquiesced, but expressed
their approval of the Bodleian rule.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Barlow's Argument, p. 9.</p></div>

<p>On August 29, 1654, a grace was passed in Convocation,
which permitted Selden to borrow MSS. from the collections
of Barocci, Roe, and Digby, provided he did not
have more than three at a time, and that he gave bond
in &pound;100 (not &pound;1000 as Hearne states<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>) for the return
of each of them within a year<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. Barlow<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> declares that
this was illegal and null; and it may be observed in passing
that the whole history of the Selden bequest needs fresh
investigation. This same year that grand scholar's books
began to arrive in Oxford, and his executors stipulated,
<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>as a condition of the gift, that no book from his collection
should hereafter be lent to any person upon any condition
whatsoever. This also must by no means be forgotten,
because we shall by and by see the Curators again and
again strangely oblivious of the conditions on which the
University received these invaluable books.</p>

<p>At the Visitation on Nov. 8, 1686, it was ordered that
notice be given that 'nullus in posterum quemlibet librum
aut volumen extra Bibliothecam asportet,' and that monition
be sent to every College and Hall for the return of
any books taken out within three days<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Macray, Annals, p. 109.</p></div>

<p>In 1789 a lazy and incompetent Librarian, John Price,
is said to have lent the Rector of Lincoln a copy of Cook's
Voyages, presented to the Library by George III, telling
him that the longer he kept it the better, 'for if it
was known to be in the Library, he (Price) should be
perpetually plagued with enquiries after it<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.' What the
Curators were about to permit such irregularities it is
difficult to imagine; at any rate here you had eight picked
men&mdash;Dr. Joseph Chapman, President of Trinity, Vice-Chancellor;
the two Proctors; Dr. Randolph, Professor of
Divinity, and afterwards successively Bishop of Oxford and
of Bangor; Dr. Vansittart, Professor of Civil Law; Dr.
Vivian, Professor of Medicine; Dr. Blayney, Professor
of Hebrew; William Jackson, Professor of Greek and
afterwards Bishop of Oxford:&mdash;they are men, citizens,
members of a learned corporation, trustees; they have
solemnly sworn by everything which they profess to hold
sacred, that they will faithfully observe the statutes; and
what was required of them? As much sense of duty as
you expect and commonly find in a watcher or a gamekeeper;
yet, till they were roused by the public protest
of Dr. Beddowes, they seem to have shewed no trace or
feeling of responsibility at all.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Macray, Annals, p. 198.</p></div>

<p>Down to the year 1856 the Bodleian Curators were
eight in number, namely, the Vice-Chancellor, the two
<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>Proctors, and the Regius Professors of Divinity, Hebrew,
Greek, Medicine, and Civil Law. Eight is rather a large
number, and the larger any board is the weaker becomes
the sense of personal responsibility. No man feels that
he is answerable for anything, because he is sunk and
extinguished in a majority or a minority; and yet, without
a keen sense of personal responsibility, all business is
laxly and badly done, even when it is done at all. The
artificial privacy of our proceedings is also an evil. In
theory all our meetings are public, so far at least as
Convocation is concerned; in fact, they are private; yet,
if the University always knew not only what is done,
but who it is that does it; if our acts were duly published,
as they ought to be, in the University Gazette, probably
both board and University would be the better for it,
and it is certain that the affairs of the Library would be
none the worse.</p>

<p>If Bodley argued that men who teach a subject are
necessarily acquainted with its literature, and are consequently
the fittest guardians and directors of a library,
he argued very badly, and in ignorance of facts. Ability
to teach a subject is one thing; knowledge of the literature
of that subject&mdash;such knowledge as is required in the
superintendents of a library&mdash;is a totally different thing.
The two may be indeed united, but very rarely are so.
A man, for instance, may be a finished Latin scholar
without ever having heard of Coster's Donatus, and without
being able to offer an opinion on that or on any of
the other editions in which Dutch libraries glory. Probably
not one man in fifty who reads the sentence which
I have just written will have the very remotest idea of
its true meaning; and if he has not, it will not follow
that he is a dunce, or that he is a poor Latinist; all
that follows is that he has much to learn before he is
fit to take any part in the management of a large library.
What is wanted, what in fact is necessary, is that sort
of knowledge which the Italian government proposes to
give to all employed in the libraries under its control.<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
In Rome and in Florence a course of bibliographical
instruction and examination has lately been instituted.
The syllabus of the course, which is a very good one,
lies before me, and in it the subject is divided into six
parts: 1. Paleografia, 2. Bibliologia, 3. Bibliografia, 4. Biblioteconomia,
5. Amministrazione, 6. Lingue. The knowledge
required is neither recondite nor profound, yet I shudder
to think what the result would be were we Curators to
submit ourselves to the tender mercies of this Italian
board. To speak for myself, I should have faced such
an examination without the least trepidation some twenty
years ago; but now, though I have been trying to brush
up faded knowledge, I would not stake a single sixpence
on a favorable issue; and to judge from all I have seen
and heard during the last two years, I suspect that, though
a few might perhaps scramble through, the great majority
of us would emerge from the ordeal more completely
plucked than was the unhappy bird, which Diogenes introduced
to the astonished disciples with the words 'Here
is Plato's man!'</p>

<p>In 1856 the University, probably suspecting that the
board as originally constituted was not the best that
could be devised, yet timidly shrinking from a radical
and salutary reform, endeavoured to improve matters by
a measure which, if it remedied one defect, unquestionably
increased another. It made a board already too large,
still larger by the addition of five members elected by
Congregation. In the course of thirty years fourteen
different men have been so elected. That all were properly
qualified to discharge the duties of their office no one
will assert who knows what those qualifications are. Why
they were chosen the University best knows. If Congregation
would but remember what a unique and priceless
treasure it possesses in this noble library, if it only knew
how easy it is for rashness and ignorance to damage and
to ruin it, how difficult it is even for knowledge to preserve
it, ability and willingness to serve it would be the
indispensable and the only qualifications demanded, and<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
neither age nor rank, dignity, nor above all party, would
be for one moment taken into account. It may be remarked
that all the thirteen Curators very rarely attend
a meeting: in the course of the last two years such a
thing has happened once only; but a board, the members
of which attend intermittently, is apt to show signs of
discontinuity in its proceedings; and a firm, consistent
policy is as necessary in the management of a library as
it is in any other affair of life. What is wanted in
Curators is common sense, business capacity, and a special
knowledge of books. No one would dream of appointing
any man an inspector of locomotives on a railway,
unless he were thoroughly acquainted with the structure
and working of a locomotive, and capable, at a push, of
driving it himself: a large library is as complex as a
locomotive, and quite as difficult to manage effectively.
Experts, who are not so numerous as might be supposed,
will back me in this assertion; but Convocation must not
be astonished if it is hotly and contemptuously denied.</p>

<p>The minutes of the Curators' Meetings begin on March
20, 1793, and, with a break of some four years when there
are none (from Nov. 26, 1849, to May 27, 1854), they
continue to the present time.</p>

<p>On Dec. 7, 1803, four printed books were allowed to go
out of the Library 'for the use of the Clarendon Press,
to be returned when done with,' contrary to statute so
far as appears; and there was a somewhat similar transaction
on June 2, 1815.</p>

<p>On Nov. 27, 1841, the sum of &pound;500 was paid for the
Sanscrit MSS. of Prof. H. H. Wilson, who 'stipulated that
the Boden Professor of Sanscrit for the time being should
be allowed the privilege of borrowing MSS. (not more
than two volumes at one time), giving for them a receipt,
and engagement for their safe return.'</p>

<p>In 1850 came the Government Commission. The Commissioners
have a good deal to say about the Bodleian,
which will be found in their Report made in 1852, p. 115
sqq. I do not quote their remarks for a reason which<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
appears to me valid. There were seven Commissioners
all told, and although they were very eminent persons,
there was not one amongst them, so far as I can discover,
who had any special knowledge of libraries, or of the
best way of managing them. Moreover, I myself heard
one of those seven Commissioners say, more than once
in the course of conversation, that he should think it
no particular misfortune if the Bodleian and its contents
were totally destroyed. Nor do I feel called upon to
incur the expense of reproducing <i>in extenso</i> the evidence
on which the Commissioners based their recommendations.
It may be sufficient to say that the following witnesses
were in favour of the lending system, some with restrictions
and some with hardly any:&mdash;the Rev. R. W. Browne; the
Rev. R. Walker; the Rev. B. Jowett; the Rev. W. H.
Cox; E. A. Freeman, Esq.; the Rev. H. Wall; the Rev.
R. Congreve; Sir E. Head; N. S. Maskelyne, Esq.; and
the Rev. J. Griffiths. It is not very easy to say whether
Prof. H. H. Wilson and Dr. Greenhill did or did not
belong to the lending party; but if they did, they proposed
such restrictions as would materially lessen the evil. Prof.
H. H. Vaughan (a most wordy person) wished to confine
the right of borrowing to the Professors. Against lending
were H. E. Strickland, Esq.; Prof. W. F. Donkin; the
Rev. R. Scott; Travers Twiss, Esq.; Dr. Macbride; the
Rev. E. S. Ffoulkes; and Dr. Phillimore: and I hope
nobody will be offended if I say that knowledge of books
and the way to use them is, as might be expected, very
much more conspicuous in those who oppose lending than
in those who advocate it. The Rev. R. W. Browne observes,
that 'probably manuscripts and such books as are unable
to be replaced should not be lent, because it would be
quite worth the while of those who wished to consult
them to visit the Library for that purpose.' It is not
often that one meets with so cogent a piece of reasoning,
and Mr. Browne's 'because' proves that he had studied
Logic with considerable benefit; he also thinks that the
system in the Public Library at Cambridge 'works well.'<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
Another witness tells us that 'the experience of the Cambridge
University Library, and of many foreign libraries,
shews that this [i. e. lending under certain restrictions]
can be done without danger, and with small loss compared
to the immense benefit obtained by it.' Sir Edmund
Head also admires the G&ouml;ttingen and Cambridge plan,
and avers that experience has proved that the risk of loss
and damage is groundless. How different are these airy
speculations from the hard facts of Mr. Bradshaw the
Cambridge Librarian, of the Librarian of the Advocates'
Library at Edinburgh, and of Mr. Panizzi (see below,
p. 50 sqq.); but then these gentlemen had the immense
and perhaps unfair advantage of knowing what they were
talking about.</p>

<p>In 1853 a Report and Evidence upon the recommendations
of H. M.'s Commissioners was presented to the Heads of
Houses. "The Committee think that the opportunity
at present allowed for lending books in <i>special cases</i>, by
permission of Convocation, is sufficient to meet extreme
cases; and that it is unnecessary to give power to the
Curators to lend books from the Library."</p>

<p>Dr. Pusey's evidence (p. 172) is that of a man who
knows something of books, and he points out how very
fallacious is Sir E. Head's reference to the G&ouml;ttingen
Library, which is altogether of a different character from
the Bodleian. "In 1825 it consisted almost entirely of
modern books, and whatever accessions it may since have
had, it cannot, like the Bodleian, have any large proportion
of books, which, if lost, could not be replaced." Dr. Pusey
is strongly against lending Bodleian books; but how little
of principle there was in his objection will be seen further
on, where we shall find him more than once advocating
loans. The Rev. C. Marriott is also, on very sensible
grounds, against lending; yet it should in common fairness
be known that he borrowed a most valuable manuscript
out of Oriel College Library, and died with it in his
possession. It was nearly sent to Africa by his executors,
and was at last, together with other books, actually <i>given</i><span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
(in all innocence of course) to Bradfield College, from
which establishment Oriel at last retrieved it; so that
in his case, as in that of Dr. Pusey, excellent principles
were joined to very loose practice.</p>

<p>Dr. Bandinel, Bodley's Librarian, gives evidence which
is short and sweet. "However weighty some reasons may
appear, the evidence materially preponderates against
lending books out of the Library. I need only quote
one great authority, that of Niebuhr," which he does;
the passage is given below, p. 49. Dr. Bandinel also
adds, "I have had a long conversation with the Librarian
of the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh, who stated, that
upon comparing the books in that Library with their
different Catalogues previous to the formation of a new
Catalogue, it was found that owing to the practice of
lending books from the Library they had lost upwards
of 6000, indeed very near 7000 works." Evidence, p. 325;
an instructive comment on the lending system.</p>

<p>About this time, however, 'University Reform,' the
true meaning of which most of us here know, was in
the air, and on May 22, 1856, the old Library Statutes
were abolished and an entirely new one enacted. Bodley's
own statute against letting books go out of the Library
was of course abrogated. That Convocation still retained
the right to lend is beyond question; but did anybody
else, Curators or Librarian, acquire the right to
do so? That the University did not intend to convey
any such right seems perfectly clear; for the 11th clause
of the new statute (which is identical with the present
statute, Tit. XX. iii. &sect; 11, paragraphs 1 to 6) is headed
"De libris extra Bibliothecam ad tempus detinendis, <i>aut
etiam</i> efferendis." Now whoever says '<i>or even</i> to have them
taken out,' and then proceeds to order whither they shall be
taken, namely to the Camera, forbids by implication their
removal from the Library on any other terms, or to any
other place than those expressly mentioned. That the
University, whatever its intentions may have been, did
not as a matter of fact convey the right to any one is<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
obvious from the statute itself; and as the Curators never
at any time possessed the right of lending books, it is
equally plain that they could not acquire it without an
express commission from the University. That the Curators
themselves were of this opinion is clear from a resolution
of theirs arrived at on Oct. 29, 1859, more than three
years after the statute was passed. I should say that
in the interval no loan was sanctioned by Convocation,
or, so far as appears, even applied for. On Oct. 29, 1859,
nine Curators being present, 'The Vice-Chancellor mentioned
the desire of the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; to be allowed
to have books out of the Bodleian Library for the purposes
of study by Grace of Convocation. The Curators resolved:&mdash;That
it was not expedient that such a proposition
should be made to Convocation.' The Curators, or a
majority of them, did not dream of arrogating to themselves
the power of lending, and they, as well as the
applicant, assume as self-evident that books could not be
borrowed. Books could be sent to the Camera; they
could not go elsewhere without the sanction of Convocation.
The new statute then did not make lending
(except by Convocation) lawful, nor was there any intention
to make it lawful.</p>

<p>That same year, on Nov. 8, a Curator gave notice
that he would move:&mdash;'That Books and MSS. be taken
out of the Bodleian Library under special conditions with
consent of the Curators;' that is, according to my view
of the case, he gave notice of a motion to take by force
and illegally a power which the University had not
given; but it does not appear by the minutes that any
such motion was actually made.</p>

<p>On Oct. 25, 1860, 'leave was granted by Convocation for
the lending two Laud Manuscripts, 561 and 563, being
copies of the <i>Historia Hierosoylmitana</i>, by Albert of
Aix, to the French Government<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.' Of this loan there is,
I believe, no trace in the minutes, but it is one more
<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>proof that the Curators, or a majority of them, did not
believe either in their right or in their power to lend
books. Whether Convocation lent these two Laudian
manuscripts under bond duly approved, and for the purposes
of publication, Mr. Macray does not state; but it
looks very much as if the University was just as ignorant
of its obligations as the Curators of a later date were of
theirs.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Macray, Annals, p. 295.</p></div>

<p>On Feb. 4, 1862, a man applied for a printed book,
which he wanted for a law case in which he was engaged;
the result was this:&mdash;"Resolved&mdash;That, there being nothing
in the present statutes to forbid the exercise of the discretion
of the Curators in such a case, the book in question
be lent, under such securities and with such precautions as
the Librarian may deem necessary." Let any man read the
eleventh and twelfth sections of the present Bodleian
Statute (identical, so far as the present question is concerned,
with that of 1856), and he will see that no discretion
is left to the Curators at all; there is no hint, however
faint, of "such a case." In 1862, Feb. 4, the Curators
assume that they have a power to lend books; on Nov. 7
of the same year they go a step further, for they leave it
'to the discretion of the Librarian to lend, if he shall deem
fit, a certain MS. to the Belgian Government.' Having
themselves no power to lend, they authorise the Librarian
to lend if he chooses.</p>

<p>In 1863, Feb. 17, notice was given of the following
motion:&mdash;'That on application from the Professors teaching
at the Museum the Bodley Librarian be empowered to lend,
for a limited time, any books bearing on the subjects there
taught that are wanted by the Students at the Museum;
the books to be returned at the end of each term:' and
on March 17 of the same year this motion was carried
with certain alterations, 'and it was resolved that it should
be referred to the Council with a view on their approval
of obtaining the sanction of Convocation'; in other words,
the Curators acknowledged that Convocation could lend,
and that they themselves could not lawfully do so.<span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>In 1859 the Curators, or a majority of them, are clear
that they have no power to lend: in 1862 they assume
that they have the power, moreover they exercise it, and
they authorise the Librarian to lend a MS. to the Belgian
Government; yet on Feb. 16, 1864, they appear to disclaim
this power, for they resolve, 'That it be proposed to Convocation
to lend three Icelandic MSS.&mdash;to the Icelandic
Society in Copenhagen at the request of the Danish
Minister.' They either had the power to lend, or they
had not: if they had, this application to Convocation was
unnecessary; if they had not, they had been occupied for
some time in the not very dignified employment of ignoring
a statute which it was their peculiar duty to observe.</p>

<p>On April 20, 1864, Dr. Pusey most inconsistently moves
that a Syriac MS. be lent; and on May 11 lent it was.</p>

<p>In 1865, March 11, a foreigner has leave 'to borrow
Arabian MSS., provided the application for the use thereof
be made through the Saxon Minister, and a bond for &pound;50
entered into for the safe return.'</p>

<p>On June 3, 'the use of Manuscripts 169&mdash;187 was
granted on the application of Lord John Russell to the
French Government for the use of the Imprimerie of Paris
[<i>sic</i>] for two months.'</p>

<p>In 1866 the Curators lent manuscripts to the University
Library of G&ouml;ttingen; and in 1868, Jan. 31, 'it was
resolved to lend MS. Selden B. 31 to the Prussian
Government.' Ye Gods and Goddesses! We only got
Selden's books at all by consenting to the condition that
they never should be lent under any circumstances whatever;
and here we have five Curators, 'all honorable
men,' quietly sending off one of Selden's manuscripts to
Germany. On March 21st of the same year, three Curators
send off another of Selden's MSS. to London. In 1868 an
application for the loan of four Hebrew manuscripts was
granted, and apparently they went to a private house.
On Feb. 9, 1869, two Curators, one being Dr. Pusey, 'were
requested to act in the matter of the loan of Hebrew MSS.
<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>to Mr. &mdash;&mdash; of &mdash;&mdash; College, Cambridge.' On April 17 of
the same year a Laudian MS. was lent to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;;
there is not a syllable in the minutes about a bond,
though that was absolutely necessary, nor any statement
that the book was required for the purpose of publication;
Laud's stipulations are quietly, and no doubt
ignorantly broken under the presidency of the Vice-Chancellor.
From this time loans are perpetually being made;
and at least six manuscripts other than those mentioned
above were lent this year. At one meeting (May
22) the whole business was the granting of loans. In
1870 fifteen MSS. at least were lent, including one of
Douce's&mdash;poor fellow! he little dreamt of the fate in
store for his lovely books. One MS. out of the archives
was sent to Philadelphia! In 1871 some thirty manuscripts
were lent; many to private hands; others to Berlin,
Cambridge, and Philadelphia. Not content with these
exploits, the Curators positively sent the 39th volume
of the Camden Society's publications to Rouen! In
1872 nearly thirty manuscripts were lent: one 'subject
to the approval of the Librarian,' thus granting to him
concurrent authority with themselves. These books went
some to private persons; others to Cambridge, London,
Leyden, Berlin, Munster, Leipzic, Kiel, Philadelphia, and
elsewhere. The manuscript sent to Munster was an old
English book of Laud's; there was no bond, nor is there
any hint that it was lent for publication. Besides manuscripts
they lent printed books, amongst the rest Tyndale's
New Testament of 1534! This portentous act was perpetrated
on May 25th, 1872; and the same day there appears
this entry on the minutes: 'In reference to applications
for loans during the Long Vacation, it was agreed, on
the suggestion of the Librarian, that he be empowered
in urgent cases, with the assent of two Curators, to grant
loans during the Long Vacation'; an utterly illegal resolution
not rescinded till 1886.</p>

<p>For ten years, ever since 1862, the Curators had been
lending, on their own authority, and without a shadow
of statutable right, manuscripts and printed books to<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
persons in Oxford and other parts of England, as well
as to foreign countries: will it be believed that on
Feb. 8, 1873, the Librarian was asked to state his opinion
as to 'the lending of books out of the Library under
proper restrictions;' and that on Feb. 28 of the same
year, 'it was agreed that the Curators should proceed
by statute to take power to order the lending out of
books under certain restrictions'? Why this was the
very thing they had been doing for years past; and
now by agreeing 'to proceed by statute' they plainly
declare their opinion that for all those years they had
been doing something for which they had no statutable
warrant. However, they drew up a draft statute which
was laid before Council, and Council promptly 'struck
out the proposal to lend books out of the Library;'
whereupon on March 8th, 1873, one of the Curators moved
'that Council be requested to insert a provision that books
be lent out from evening to morning. This was agreed
to'. On which resolution I shall make no remark, for
fear my pen might run away with me; but most people
will be able to supply that comment which I refrain
from making.</p>

<p>This very year 1873 they lent the York Missal, unless
in the judgment of the Librarian 'too valuable to be
lent out of the Library': there is a touch of modesty
in this which disarms me, otherwise I could say something
very true, but very unpleasant. The same year
an application was made for one of the Douce MSS.,
but 'by reason of regulations as to Douce MSS. this
was refused.' What regulations these were it would be
interesting to know, for I cannot discover that there are
at present any regulations, at all events in writing.</p>

<p>At length the Curators obtained their desire. On
March 25, 1873, a form of statute was proposed by one
Head of a House and seconded by another, and on
May 2, 1873, it was carried without a division in the
following shape: (Tit. XX. iii. &sect; 11. 10.) Liceat Curatoribus,
sicut mos fuit, libros impressos et manuscriptos,<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
scienti&aelig; causa, viris doctis sive Academicis sive externis
mutuari: that is to say, <i>Let it be lawful for the Curators,
as the custom has been, to borrow books printed and manuscript
in the interest of knowledge for learned men, whether
Members of the University or not</i>. A board of grave
and learned men&mdash;<i>viri variis doctrinis et literis imbuti</i>,
as the statute says&mdash;wish to do openly, what they had
been in the habit of doing, as it would appear, unknown
to Council, and against its wishes (for it 'struck out
the proposal to lend books out of the Library'): there
is something droll in that, but it is nothing to what
came of it. They petition for leave to <i>lend</i>, walk off
perfectly contented with a permission to <i>borrow</i>, and nobody
sees the joke! 'Reform' seems not only to have
impaired our knowledge of Latin, but to have diminished
our sense of the ridiculous&mdash;a most dolorous result. That
Convocation intended by this strangely worded statute to
convey to the Curators the power to <i>lend</i> books is beyond
question; it is equally beyond question that it conveyed
the power to <i>borrow</i> them, for in good Latin and in
our statute Latin alike, <i>mutuari</i> means not to lend, but
to borrow, as every Latin Dictionary from the Hortus
Vocabulorum down to Lewis and Short testifies; and
as to our statute Latin we find: quantum magister ...
potest de cista de Guildeforde mutuari (Anstey, p. 99);
quod magister regens mutuari possit quadraginta solidos
(<i>ibid.</i> p. 132); de eadem mutuari poterit ad usum suum
proprium.... quinque marcas (<i>ibid.</i> p. 338). As <i>mutuari</i>
is correctly used in the barbarous language of our old
statutes, so is it in the more polished Latinity of the
Laudian code, in which the word occurs once, and I
think only once, and as the devil of mischief will have
it, in the Bodleian Statute itself, where 'e cista D. Thom&aelig;
Bodley mutuari' means 'to borrow from Sir Thomas
Bodley's chest'. The meaning of the word then is clear
beyond dispute, and what it means in one part of the
statutes it must mean in another. There is plenty of
barbarous Latin in our statute book, but in every case<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
it is justified or excused by long usage, or by the fact
that other learned bodies have constantly used the same
or similar language; but the statute of 1873 is probably
the only one either in ancient or modern times, where
without necessity, without precedent, and without warning,
a word which means and always has meant one thing
is used under the erroneous impression that it means
another, and that not by schoolboys, but by their elders.
A statute, however, means what it plainly says: with
the intentions of a legislative body we have no concern
except in so far as they are clearly expressed, and every
prudent judge knows what grave evils spring from neglect
of this principle of interpretation. (See Dwarris On
Statutes, p. 580 sqq.)</p>

<p>Whether this statute really gives the power to lend
may be disputed. On the one hand it may be said,
that those who borrow a book <i>for</i> learned men may do
what they like with it, and may therefore lend it. At
first sight this seems probable and reasonable, but the
more it is thought of the less probable does it appear.
On the other hand it may be said, that since the statute
does not plainly and expressly give the Curators the
power to lend, they have no power to do so at all. Be
that as it may, no such scruples troubled the minds of
the Curators; every one seems to have been completely
mesmerised, and this singular statute was straightway put
in practice after a fashion; for on June 23, 1873, 'an
application from Professor &mdash;&mdash; was considered, asking
for loan of such books or MSS. as he might require,
at the discretion of the Librarian, under the provisions of
&sect;11, ch. 10 of the Bodleian amended statute, during the
present vacation. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and Mr. &mdash;&mdash; made similar
applications. It was agreed to accede to the request in the
case of the three applicants respectively'; that is to say,
within a few days of the passing of the statute it is broken.
The Curators do not agree to borrow books for the applicants,
the only thing the statute allowed them to
do; the statute says not one word about the discretion<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
of the Librarian, nor does it allow the Curators in this
case to leave anything to it: in the buying of books
(Stat. XX. iii. &sect; 4, 4) they may leave much to his
discretion, but nowhere else is any such permission given:
so the Curators took it. They did not do what the statute
says they may do, and they did do what no statute permits
them to do; and as they began that day, so have they
continued to this moment. No change is made in the
minutes. Before as well as after the passing of this statute
the form always is 'applications for loans,' or some equivalent
phrase. In 1873 a dozen MSS. or more, besides
printed books, including the Hereford Missal! were lent
exactly as before, some to private persons, some to libraries,
and they went to Leeds, Cambridge, Utrecht, Kiel,
Berlin, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In 1874 more than twenty MSS. were lent to Jena,
Cambridge, Marburg, Vienna (two of the Junius collection
were sent there), and to private hands. In 1875 MSS.
were sent to St. Petersburg, Bonn, Vienna, Paris, Cambridge,
Edinburgh, Konigsberg, Heidelberg, and some to
private houses; three printed books also were lent, without
a shadow of reason so far as can be seen, to a gentleman
residing in the Temple.</p>

<p>On Oct. 30 two of the sub-librarians applied 'for the
privilege of taking books out of the Library. Their application
was agreed to upon the terms stated in the minutes
of June 23, 1873, in the case of a similar application
from others.'</p>

<p>And here it should be noticed that all the loans do
not by any means necessarily appear in the minutes. Owing
to the illegal resolution of the Curators of May 25, 1872,
(see above, p. 16,) no loans during the Long Vacation are
there entered. Moreover, at some time unknown to me
the Librarian was quietly permitted to let certain persons
borrow books at his discretion, and there at last grew up,
it is to be presumed, with the knowledge of the Curators,
what the Library officials call the Borrowers' List, and what
after a time appears in the minutes as 'the privileged<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
list.' As every one can see, there is nothing whatever in
the statute to justify all this.</p>

<p>I do not for one moment mean to charge the Curators
with doing anything which they thought to be improper
or beyond their discretion; but I do most distinctly charge
them with having in fact exceeded their statutable powers,
and with taking the law into their own hands, all, I doubt
not, with the best and most innocent intentions. Unfortunately
some of the most mischievous acts in the world
have been done with the best and purest intentions. Like
all other members of the University the Curators have
promised to observe the statutes, and the Vice-Chancellor
and Proctors have not only done that, but have solemnly
pledged themselves to see that the statutes are observed,
and are moreover armed with power to enforce them.
If statutes are absurd, it is clearly the duty of those
who control legislation in this place to get them abolished
or amended without delay; if they are not absurd, all
are bound to obey them. As regards the Bodleian
there is a special order (XX. iii. &sect; 12. 3) directing the
Curators what to do with an imperfect statute, and how
to do it; but it is one thing to make a statute; it
is a very different thing to get people to obey it. No
one who sees the ease with which statutes are made
and unmade, can doubt, that if those of the Bodleian
are defective in any respect, it needs but a word from
one or two members of Council to have all defects
remedied. If the Curators want fresh powers, or more
discretion, and greater latitude of action than they are
at present allowed, they have but to ask and obtain;
but I protest most vehemently against the usurpation
of powers not granted by the University as a thing
<i>pessimi exempli</i>. If the Bodleian Curators are to do
exactly as they like, the University might just as well
spare itself the trouble of legislation. If the University
deliberately chooses to have its statutes nullified, there
is, I suppose, no help for it; yet I cannot but suspect
that the University has no knowledge&mdash;at all events no<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
clear and distinct knowledge&mdash;of the way in which we
have dealt with the statutes which were intended to
mark out our duties. The secret growth of 'the borrowers'
list' is as singular a thing as is to be found
in the history of the Bodleian. The Curators and the
Curators alone have, by a statute of their own devising,
a right to borrow; yet the late Librarian assumed to
himself the right of naming persons who are to have the
privilege of borrowing, and the Curators quietly allowed
it, without, as I believe, the faintest suspicion that they
were doing what was wrong.</p>

<p>In 1876 eleven MSS. went some to private persons, others
to Augsburg, Paris, G&ouml;ttingen, Heidelberg, Cambridge:
the book sent to Augsburg without bond, and without
guarantee for publication, was one of Laud's Greek MSS.
On June 24 an application 'from Mr. &mdash;&mdash; for use of
books at home during Vacation' was 'assented to.' In
1877 some fourteen or fifteen MSS. were sent to
Heidelberg, Paris, Cambridge, London, Rome, Copenhagen,
Munich, Marburg, besides printed books: the
book sent to Munich was one of Laud's, again in total
defiance of all his stipulations.</p>

<p>In 1878 a dozen MSS., or more, went to different people,
to Bonn, to Pesth, Leyden, and Rostock, besides printed
books: one book with illuminations was refused, 'as being
one of a class not lent out.' I have before observed that
I know of no written rules at all. On Oct. 26 of this
year the Curators surpassed themselves, for there was an
application 'from the Rev. &mdash;&mdash;, Fellow of &mdash;&mdash; College,
for permission to borrow works from the Library to be
taken to his rooms. In this matter it was agreed that
power to act on the clause 10, &sect; 11 of the Bodleian
Statute <i>be delegated</i> by the Curators to the Librarian.'
There were ten Curators present on this memorable occasion.
The Curators are themselves delegates, and if they had the
right to delegate to the Librarian the power which the
University delegated to them, then what is sauce for the
goose is sauce for the gander: if the Curators <i>mero motu</i><span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
may delegate their powers, the Librarian may with equal
right and equal reason delegate his, and so on <i>in infinitum</i>,
to the utter ruin of all sense of responsibility.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to enumerate all the loans; suffice
it to say that they have gone on year after year; and
from this point I shall only mention a few notable cases.</p>

<p>On May 31, 1879, 'the request of Professor &mdash;&mdash; to
borrow printed books from the Library was granted.' Considering
that only seven months before, the Curators had
resolved 'to delegate' their lending powers to the Librarian,
it is strange that they did not refer the applicant straight
to that official.</p>

<p>In 1880, June 11, a Selden MS. was ordered to Paris;
ten Curators were present, and it is to be presumed that
not one of them knew, what he was bound to know,
namely, the special stipulation made with respect to all
Selden's books.</p>

<p>On Oct. 29, 1880, the Junior Proctor gave notice of
the following motion:&mdash;'That in the case of MSS. sent
out on loan to persons resident within the United Kingdom,
a pecuniary bond shall be executed by the person
to whom such MS. is lent, of such value as shall be
determined from time to time by the Curators, unless
the MS. is sent for use only within the precincts of the
British Museum, or some other approved Public Library.'
On Nov. 27 this motion was made and lost.</p>

<p>In 1881, June 4, 'an application from &mdash;&mdash; for the
use of books dealing with the subject of Biblical Chronology
at his own house appeared to the Curators to
fall under the provisions of the Statute XX. iii. &sect; 11,
10; the Librarian exercising discretion as to the number
of volumes issued.' On Oct. 26, 1878, not three years
before, the Curators formally 'delegated' their powers
to the Librarian; on May 31, 1879, they assume that
they possess what they have 'delegated'; and here they
do the same thing, and all this without any formal and
solemn resumption by them of their 'delegated' powers.
<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>On Oct. 29, 1881, it was reported that Professor &mdash;&mdash; of
Cambridge had not returned a manuscript borrowed <i>four
years</i> before, and the Vice-Chancellor was requested to
communicate with the Professor in the matter. The
manuscript never has been, and in all probability never
will be restored, and our only consolation must be the
fact that it was a transcript of another manuscript in
the Bodleian, not on that account necessarily of little
value, for a transcript may, and sometimes does, become
of inestimable value; why it does so, all acquainted with
books know.</p>

<p>In 1882, Feb. 11, a Laudian MS. was ordered to Heidelberg,
and a Selden MS. to St. Petersburg. On Dec. 2,
1882, 'it was agreed that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, Fellow of &mdash;&mdash;
be one of the persons privileged to take out books.
It was agreed that the Librarians be allowed to take
out books and MSS. for their own use.'</p>

<p>In 1883, Jan. 27, the Librarian suggested 'that all
Fellows and ex-Fellows of Colleges should be entitled
to have books out of the Library'; the suggestion was
not adopted. On the same day, 'Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (&mdash;&mdash;
College) and Dr. &mdash;&mdash; were placed on the list of
persons specially entitled.' On March 3 of the same
year, 'Dr. Frankfurter's application to be placed on the
privileged list of borrowers was assented to.' There we
have it at last, in black and white&mdash;<i>the privileged list
of borrowers</i>, as unstatutable and as illegal a thing as
could well be permitted. The words '<i>let it be lawful for
the Curators to borrow books for learned men</i>,' (always
supposing the Latin not to be downright nonsense,) cannot
convey to the Curators the power to let other people
borrow books; for if they could, then any words may
have any meaning, which comes to the same thing as
saying that they have no meaning at all. Yet it is on
these words, and on these words alone, that the 'borrowers'
list' has been made to depend; though how educated
men can have extracted from this statute any meaning
whatever which would justify, or even seem, in the most
distant way, to justify the act of conveying to others<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
the power to borrow books from the library is one of the
most astonishing things that I ever met with in the whole
course of my life. But it will be said that the Bodleian
Curators for thirteen years understood <i>mutuari</i> to mean
'lend', and therefore they might institute a 'borrowers'
list'. It is an astonishing, not to say staggering, fact
that they did so understand it, yet the borrowers' list is
none the less illegal. Nay, I have heard a Curator in
his place maintain, that as there could be no doubt what
the University intended when it passed this statute, <i>mutuari</i>
in this place must mean 'lend'. Much as I admired
the boldness of the assertion, I was unable to commend
either the law or the logic of it; the consequences which
would at once follow from the position, that if the intentions
of a legislative body are clear it matters not how
it expresses them, are too palpably absurd to find acceptance
with ordinary minds. However, let it be supposed,
that instead of <i>mutuari</i> the word actually used were
<i>commodare</i>. You are still no better off. The University
on this hypothesis gives to the Curators as a board the
power of lending a specific book to a specific person,
and that is all. It does not give the Curators the power
to invest any person or persons with the right or privilege
of borrowing books, still less does it convey the power
of creating a class of persons who have such a right or
privilege. This is not only clear to plain common sense,
but, as I am advised, is plain as a matter of law; and
I am further assured that, if any book is damaged or
lost in consequence of the Curators persisting in such
a course, they become themselves personally liable to the
University.</p>

<p>This illegal borrowers' list comprises at this moment
(subtracting one dead man and double entries) one hundred
and eleven persons, besides the Clarendon Press. Among
these persons are two ladies, who can have no conceivable
right to be where they are, for even those whose tolerant
Latinity suffers them to take <i>mutuari</i> for <i>commodare</i> will
hardly maintain that '<i>viris doctis</i>' covers learned women.<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
It includes too non-residents and foreigners; and I am
informed that manuscripts have been sent for the use of
one of these persons more than a hundred miles as the crow
flies. Books are sent by post, and Bodleian money is
spent to pay for carriage. The finances of the Library,
however, deserve a paper all to themselves, and some day
they shall have one.</p>

<p>On May 26, 1883, 'an application from Dr. Leumann
to be placed on the privileged list was agreed to.' On
Oct. 20, of the same year, two persons were 'placed on
the privileged list of readers;' and on Nov. 24, another
'was placed on the privileged list;' and from that moment
to the present no other formula is employed in the minutes.</p>

<p>In 1885, Oct. 31, the Librarian applied 'for authority
to decline requests for loans of Selden MSS. and books,
and of Laud's MSS. (except for purposes of publication),
without referring the application to the Curators, as being
contrary to the terms of the respective donations. This
was agreed to.' It was, and to my great astonishment it
passed without any remark whatever.</p>

<p>In 1886, March 13, 'Liceat Curatoribus' was ruled
to mean 'the consent of a majority of Curators;' that
is to say, the illegal resolution of May 25, 1872, was
silently rescinded. On May 15 of the same year a committee
of four was appointed to consider the practice of
loans. At a meeting on June 19, another name was
added to the borrowers' list. Every Curator knew that
the legality of their practice with respect to loans, and
especially with respect to the borrowers' list, had been
openly challenged; notwithstanding this, and in spite of
protest then and there made, the chairman put the name
to the vote, and a majority actually voted for it. This
proceeding was, in my opinion (and not in mine only),
irregular and improper to say the least of it, but it was
highly characteristic. After waiting to see whether the
Vice-Chancellor or any other Curator would call attention
to the charge brought against the board, and finding, as
I was sure would be the case, that no one shewed any<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
disposition to do so, I gave notice of a motion for the
next statutable meeting:&mdash;<i>That the borrowers' list be
abolished as illegal; that all books in the hands of borrowers
be at once recalled as having been illegally lent;
and that for the future the Statute XX. iii. &sect; 11. 10 be
faithfully observed.</i></p>

<p>On June 28 it was agreed (I being silent for an obvious
reason) that during the Vacation all the Curators in Oxford
should meet every fortnight in the Library at 2 p.m.
solely to consider applications for loans. During the
Vacation six such meetings were summoned. On July 10,
three Curators met and refused an application; on Aug. 21,
and on Sept. 11, only two were present, and of course
declined to act; on Sept. 25, and Oct. 9, I, who attended
all the meetings, found myself alone; on Oct. 23, there
were six of us, and business was adjourned on the ground
that the whole question of loans would be debated on
Oct. 30. Accordingly, on Oct. 30, <i>all</i> the Curators made
their appearance, a thing I never saw before, though they
were not all present during the whole of the proceedings.
The motion to abolish the borrowers' list was duly made
and seconded; then, after some confused talk, which could
not be dignified by the name of a debate, an amendment
was moved, 'That the consideration of the regulations
under which books <i>be lent</i> be referred to a committee';
and this was carried, all the Curators being present. An
instruction to the committee was also moved, 'To consider
what alteration is required in the statute with regard to
the borrowing of books'; which was also carried. Next
we considered the report of the committee on loans, and
returned it in a somewhat mangled condition to the reconsideration
of those who drew it up. After that, applications
for loans numbered 1 to 16 were discussed,
and <i>all</i> were refused. This exhausted the agenda paper,
and should, I apprehend, have finished the business of the
day. However, an application for the loan of manuscripts
<i>not</i> on the agenda paper was considered, and the board,
which up to that moment had refused all applications,<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
including one from Sir Richard Burton, granted the loan
of <i>seventeen</i> manuscripts to <i>one</i> man. In self-defence,
let me say that I always vote against all loans when
there is a division.</p>

<p>On Nov. 8 the loan committee recommended that Council
be asked to propose amendments in Stat. Tit. XX. sect. iii.
&sect; 11, and thought that 'the farther consideration of the rules
framed by them and amended at the Curators' meeting on
Oct. 30 should for the present be postponed.' On Nov. 25,
ten Curators being present, this recommendation was considered.
One of the Curators thought that while there was
'no harm' in applying for a new statute, yet that it was
'a waste of time' and 'a little ridiculous': another wished
to move an amendment and have the new statute in <i>English</i>,
but some of us saw (though no one said so) that such an
amendment would be a highly comic confession on the
part of the <i>viri variis doctrinis et literis imbuti</i>; and
accordingly it was not pressed. Then the same Curator
proposed that <i>commodare</i> should be substituted for <i>mutuari</i>,
and that <i>sicut mos fuit</i> should be struck out. Four voted
for this amendment, which was lost. Even had it been
carried, it would still have been unlawful to lend books
to women, for, as was pointed out at the time, <i>vir</i> means
<i>a man</i>; but the minority was in no mood to be affected
by philological facts. The original recommendation was
then passed.</p>

<p>The board having thus expressed its opinion that a
new statute was necessary to enable it to lend books had,
it might be thought, asserted that the existing statute
does not enable it to do so; accordingly we at once turned
our attention to applications for loans. The first article
applied for was not a book at all, but an inscribed bronze
vessel; and it was observed that we have no statutable right,
in other words no power whatever, to lend such a thing;
whereupon some one remarked that it might be done, <i>because
it is not forbidden</i>, an argument, which (if valid)
would lead to some startling conclusions.</p>

<p>However, that a decree of Convocation to authorise the<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
loan of this vessel should be asked for was duly moved
and seconded; then the Curator, who wished to patch
the Bodleian Latin statute with a bit of English, moved
as an amendment 'that the Curators lend it', quite ignoring
the fact that they had no statutable power to do so.
For this amendment three Curators voted, one abstained,
and the rest voted against it: finally the original motion
was carried. After that, two loans of books were refused
and three were granted.</p>

<p>In applying for a decree to enable them to lend this
vessel the Curators turned over a new leaf. The whole
Bodleian statute consists of ten octavo pages, eleven lines
and four words: it can be read out aloud in thirty
minutes, and by eye alone in half that time: there is,
therefore, no excuse whatever for not knowing its contents,
and still less for not obeying it. It is not my purpose
at the present moment to point out how often, and in
how many ways, we drive a coach and four through statutes
intended to control our actions; but to complete the
subject of loans, and dismissing the practice of book-lending
from further consideration, it may be noted that the
Stat. XX. iii. &sect; 11. 9 allows the Curators under specified
conditions to place certain prints and drawings either in
the Radcliffe or in the Taylor Building; but with this
exception, if exception it be, no power is anywhere given
to them to lend any picture, coin, antiquity, or other
object belonging to the library. Nevertheless I find the
following entries in the minutes:&mdash;</p>

<p>On April 26, 1865, 'it was agreed to lend "Miniatures"
to the Lords of the Committee of Council on Education
to be exhibited in the South Kensington Museum.'</p>

<p>On Oct. 28, 1865, 'the Curators sanction the loan of
such Pictures as may be desired for the National Exhibition
of Portraits at Kensington in 1866.'</p>

<p>On Dec. 12, 1865, 'that the loan of the Pictures according
to the list sent, save that of Sir Thomas Bodley, be granted
to South Kensington Museum Exhibition of National
Portraits.'<span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>On March 8, 1867, 'a letter from the Secretary of the
Earl of Derby was read asking for the loan of eighteen
Pictures for exhibition at Kensington. This was acceded
to.'</p>

<p>On Jan. 31, 1868, 'it was resolved ... to lend to the
Leeds Exhibition the Portraits they wish of Yorkshire
Worthies.'</p>

<p>On Feb. 5, 1870, 'an application from Mr. Cosmo Innis,
of the General Register house, Edinburgh, for the loan
of the old map of Britain of the 14th century, which
hangs on the wall of the Library, to be traced in facsimile,
under the care of Sir Henry James, for the 2nd volume
of the National MSS. of Scotland, was granted.'</p>

<p>On Feb. 14, 1874, 'an application from the South
Kensington Museum was read, asking for the loan of
remarkable specimens of Book-binding for next year's
International Exhibition. In this matter it was agreed
that the Museum should be invited to send a person
to Oxford to inspect, and that it should be left to the
discretion of the Librarian to decide upon lending any
specimen required.'</p>

<p>On April 28, 1877, 'an application from Mr. Blades
[<i>sic</i>] on behalf of Caxton memorial committee for the
loan of certain early printed books to a Public Exhibition
at South Kensington was considered and granted.'</p>

<p>On May 26, 1877, application 'for Bibles to be sent
to the Caxton Exhibition. This was granted, and the
Librarian was directed to take such measures as might
be necessary to ensure secure transmission.'</p>

<p>On May 11, 1878, permission was given to lend the
Selden Portrait to the Nottingham Art Exhibition; and
an application from the Bath and West of England Agricultural
Society for works of art, &amp;c. for their approaching
meeting at Oxford, was considered. This was left to
the Librarian's discretion.</p>

<p>On Nov. 13, 1880, Wyngarde's Plan of London 'to be
granted under a bond' to Mr. Wheatley.</p>

<p>On April 29, 1882, the Portrait of Sam. Butler was lent
to the Worcestershire Exhibition of Fine Arts.<span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>On Feb. 2, 1884, Drake's Chair was lent to the Mayor of
Plymouth.</p>

<p>On May 2, 1885, 'the Librarian presented applications
from the Exhibition of Inventions now being held for
the loan of certain MSS.; certain early printed books;
certain works on music. It was agreed that the Librarian
be empowered to lend out of the above as required, as
he may think well, to the Exhibition.'</p>

<p>At this last meeting I was present, and the following is
a verbatim copy of my note written the same day:&mdash;</p>

<p>'An Exhibition of Inventions (I have not got the name
correctly) applied for the loan of certain MSS. and books
from Bodleian: 5 MSS. Liturgies: 3 Bodley MSS. 515,
775, 842: Gough, Missal 336: an Ashmole book, and
2 English.&mdash;I objected, but the loan was carried, except
as to 775 Bodley.' I have lately been informed that one
of the books sent up to be stared at by the mob of sightseers
was a Selden book: this I neither knew nor could
have known at the time, or it should have been stopped,
if protesting could have stopped it.</p>

<p>In every one of these cases the Curators, with the most
perfect innocence, took upon themselves to do what they
had not a shadow of right to do. If the University is
content to have its property so dealt with that in case
of damage or loss its only remedy would be to mulct
the Curators, there is nothing more to be said; but it
is just as well that the University should know what has
been done in the past, and what would have been done
in the future, had not a protest been made against the
practice; and even now, though the board as a board has
seemingly condemned its former doings, it still contains
a stubborn and impenitent minority. If the University
wishes its statutes to be obeyed, it should ordain substantial
pecuniary fines for breaches of them; if it does not care
whether they are obeyed or not, it is a pity that it wastes
its time in enacting them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>And now as to the policy of lending the printed books
and manuscripts of the Bodleian. The question is not
whether it is a good or a bad thing to lend books, nor
whether it is a good thing for this or that library to do
so; it is simply whether it is right to lend Bodleian books.
It may be argued that it is right to do so&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Because books are made to be used, and they will
be very much more used if they are lent than if they
are not; moreover it is generally more convenient to
read in one's own room than it is in a public place.
Some men cannot read, certainly cannot read and think
in a library, or in the midst of company; I cannot myself,
and all that I have ever been able to do in such places
is to make extracts, verify references and the like;
but to read a book as I should in my own room is to
me, and probably to many people, impossible. If you
go to a public institution you must go when it is open;
you must sit still; you must not whistle or make a noise;
you must not smoke; you cannot lie down and read on
your back; you cannot throw the book aside, go for a
walk, and resume your perusal; you cannot read quietly
over the fire of an evening; you cannot read in the small
hours of the night, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. Yet all this
you can do if you are allowed to borrow the books.
You can then treat them exactly as if they were your
own. It is clear that this argument may be expanded
in a multitude of ways, and no one is so destitute of
imagination as not to be able to fill up the details to
suit his own particular case and fancy.</p>

<p>The answer to it is very simple. You cannot by any
device or contrivance combine the advantages of private
and of public property. He who wishes to use the books
of a public library must submit to many personal inconveniences;
and the man who is unwilling to deny
himself for the general good is the very last person in
the community to whom any favour ought to be shown,
and of all people he least deserves the favour of borrowing.
He who has ever been foolish enough to lend his own books<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
freely, learns by almost unvaried experience that hardly
one man in twenty can be trusted: your book comes
back (when it comes back at all) more damaged by a
month's outing than the owner would occasion in fifty
years. The book of a public library is even less regarded,
as a rule, than that belonging to a friend; for
the friend may have a sharp tongue, and a knack of using
it, whereas a librarian is an official; even if he ever has
time to look through the books when they are returned,
his censure is disregarded, and after all accidents will
happen, and the book might possibly have been equally
damaged had it never left the library walls. It is really
astonishing how few men there are in the present day
who know how to use a book without doing it real and
often serious damage. Over and over again have I seen
men who would be very angry to be called boors deliberately
break the back of a book. Over and over again,
both in libraries and in private rooms, have I seen the
headband broken, simply because people did not know
how to take a book off a shelf. Again and again I have
seen men of education (but grossly ignorant for all that
of the ways of books) play such pranks with my own
volumes as made me shudder. The horrid trick of turning
a leaf by wetting a finger I have seen practised in this
seat of learning over and over again by Graduates, by
Professors, by Heads of Houses; and years ago I saw
that same nasty trick played <i>pro pudor!</i> in the sacred
precincts of the Bodleian itself <i>on a manuscript</i>, which
will bear to its last moment the impression of the dirty
thumb (and it <i>was</i> dirty) that perpetrated the uncleanly
act. Often and often you see a man sitting close over
the fire with a well-bound volume; a few such experiments
will ruin the binding of any book; if it is his
own, well and good, though even so the act is that of a
barbarian: but suppose it a Bodleian book, what then?
Why in that case the binding bills will be higher than
ever, to say nothing about the ruin of the book itself.
A man who knows how to handle a book will use a<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
volume habitually for years and leave no trace of wear
and tear behind him; but the average man, even though
he may be a Master of Arts, is, not unfrequently, totally
unfit to have the use of any books in good condition,
even in a library, much less out of one.</p>

<p>The scholars and readers of former days seem to have
been far more careful in their habits than men are now.
Look at the books of the great collectors&mdash;Grolier, the
Maioli, Selden, De Thou, the Colberts, and the like. These
men read their books; and Grolier and Thomas Maioli
certainly lent them: yet even after all these years, though
time and neglect may have ruined the magnificent bindings&mdash;bindings
such as few, if any, modern collectors ever
indulge in&mdash;the books themselves are internally spotless.
I have myself scores of volumes, many of them three
or four hundred years old, clean and pure as the day
they were issued from the press; they have most certainly
been used and read, but used by men of clean
hands and decent habits. In the present day books
are so common and so cheap, and modern readers too
frequently so unrefined, that they get into a vile habit
of misusing them, and to such persons&mdash;that is, to the
great majority&mdash;the books of a public library cannot
be safely trusted except under the very strictest supervision.
The slovenly practice of placing one open book
on another, a practice sternly forbidden in many foreign
libraries, may be seen in full swing both at the Camera
and in the Bodleian; and no one seems to be aware how
ruinous it is, or to have the least suspicion that he who
knows how to handle books never treats them so. Treated
in a cleanly and decent manner, there is not the least
reason why a book printed on good paper should not
last for twenty centuries or more; treated as they are too
often treated here in Oxford, they will hardly last as
many months.</p>

<p>By lending the books as we illegally do, we are perceptibly
hastening the destruction of a library intended
by its founder and benefactors to be a blessing for generations
of scholars yet unborn.<span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>2. Books are to be lent, and what is more ought to
be sent out of Oxford, because it is an immense convenience
to students at a distance to have Bodleian treasures
close at hand. Not a doubt about it; vastly convenient.
Suppose I am studying Greek sculpture, it would be very
convenient to get all the master-pieces sent from the
various galleries of Europe to London or Oxford. It
would not only be a convenience, but a joy and a delight,
to have over the Venus of Melos. Instead of sitting for
hours together, as I used to do, in the Louvre, it would
be much more convenient to go down to the New Schools
and gaze on that glorious and divine being. Does any one
suddenly scent an absurdity in the supposition? Why so
do I, but the absurdity is in the whole argument, not in
the particular application of it. Some people who have
not a gift for seeing the point of things will ride off by
saying that the Venus is a majestic beauty, and that the
expense of her carriage and insurance would be enormous.
Such an objection is pointless, because it evades the question
of convenience; but let us take a case where weight
will not oppress us. Say you study Greek gems; would
it not be very convenient to have some of the best from
Naples, from Paris, from Rome, and from Vienna, sent
here to the Bodleian, where you could study them at
your leisure? They are more portable than books, far
less liable to damage, and hardly more valuable. Do
you think that any guardian of such treasures would be
so foolish as to listen to your request? Would any
nation, city, or even University, permit it?</p>

<p>The cases, it will be said, are not parallel. Gems,
coins, medals, statuettes, are too valuable to be lent; the
books and manuscripts which the Bodleian Curators lend
are comparatively valueless. I am by no means sure of
that fact. I have before now tapped at a friend's door,
and receiving no answer entered his room to leave a message
or what not, and have more than once seen lying on his
table an eleventh-century Bodleian manuscript of a certain
classic author, a book of inestimable value, the <i>codex<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
archetypus</i> of every other copy now in existence. Any
stranger could have entered that room, and any enterprising
literary thief&mdash;a not uncommon and particularly detestable
animal&mdash;might have slipped this priceless book into his
pocket. I am by no means sure that very valuable manuscripts
have not been, in spite of remonstrance, lent out
within the last two years; but it is beyond all dispute
that not so very long ago the thing was done, and any
man or any body of men who will allow one such thing
to be done are quite capable of allowing a dozen to be
done.</p>

<p>Let it, however, be granted, for the purposes of the
present argument, that we now, having a clearer perception
of our responsibilities, only allow comparatively worthless
manuscripts to be sent to France, to Germany, Russia,
or India; for our manuscripts, be it observed, travel as
far afield as Bombay. Now what makes a book or manuscript
comparatively worthless? It is so, either because
it is one of many copies, or because it is a poor and
faulty copy. If it is one of many, why in the name of
all that is absurd should we be asked to send our goods
away (at our expense and risk let it be remembered) when
<i>ex hypothesi</i> there are many other copies in existence?
why cannot the foreign student go to some one of those
copies? why should we be called on to gratify his laziness
or consult his convenience? If the copy be a poor one,
he who asks for the loan of it must be a noodle, for
who cares for the readings of a confessedly inferior book?
Is it not clear as day that the man who at Rome, or Heidelberg,
or Bombay, asks for the loan of a manuscript,
believes it to be a good and valuable copy? moreover,
if he believes so, is it not in the highest degree probable
that his judgment is correct, seeing that his attention
is in a special manner concentrated on the matter? And
if it be a good and valuable copy, what becomes of the
plea that we only lend comparatively worthless books?
Have we any common sense amongst us? I really confess
that there are times when I come to the conclusion that<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
we have none; for if we had, how could we be deceived
by pretexts so flimsy and fallacious? All the manuscripts
which we now lend are most certainly valuable, and their
loss or damage would be irreparable; all talk of comparative
worth or worthlessness is futile, and is merely
used as so much dust thrown in the eyes of those who
(I am sorry to say it, but it must be said) ought to have
a higher conception of their duties.</p>

<p>3. Some maintain that MSS. and books should be
lent out because 'more work' will be done by that device.
It is difficult to see why. It is inferred, in fact, that
'more work' will be done, because it is more convenient
to work at home than it is in a library. A partial answer
to this fallacious plea has been already given, but I cannot
pass over the particular form of it without a protest.
The cant that is talked now-a-days about 'work' is
enough to make one sick. As far as my experience extends,
the very notion of work, as opposed to fidgetty pottering,
is not possessed by fifty men in the place; the very
conception of thoroughness and comprehension is gone;
and as to learning, why the thing has almost vanished;
of 'science' we have enough and to spare, but what in
the world has become of all our knowledge? Briefly,
at the present moment and in this place, all this wretched
pretence of 'work' is arrant imposture. A few, and only
a few, know what it means, and they would never dream
of talking about it.</p>

<p>But I have heard this argument about 'more work'
put in another form, and it obviously is a theme on which
endless variations may be composed. Suppose, it is said,
a very poor scholar, anxious to give the world a critical
edition of some book, and further suppose that there is
a valuable manuscript at St. Petersburg, another at Stockholm,
another in Paris, another in Oxford, and so on;
let the poor scholar live where you like, say in Giessen,
and suppose him to be totally unable to defray the expense
of a journey to these several places, and to have no means
of paying for collations made by others, and no confidence<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
in their correctness, even if he could pay for them; would
it not be an advantage to literature that all these manuscripts
should be sent to Giessen for the use of the
poor scholar aforesaid; and would it not be a dead loss
to the world of letters, if, by refusing so to lend them,
you prevented the poor scholar from constructing a critical
and admirable text of the author in whom he is interested?
This purely hypothetical case I have heard put in all
seriousness, and used as a knock-me-down sort of argument;
yet it must occur to any one with a grain of common
sense that it is only too easy to 'suppose' anything;
that it would not require the imaginative powers of a baby
to go one step further, and suppose the poor, the ardent
and the ripe scholar to have just money enough or pluck
enough to carry him to the places which he wishes to
visit, (I note parenthetically that a real student, a man
to read of whose exploits warms one's heart, Cosma de
K&ouml;r&ouml;s, started on his extraordinary expedition to the
East with 100 florins and a walking-stick, for being what
he was, he dispensed with luggage,) or you might suppose
brains enough in his neighbourhood to perceive that so
deserving a creature of the pure imagination might fairly
enough be helped or&mdash;but it is needless and foolish to
dream with one's eyes open, and practical men generally
object to discuss purely hypothetical cases. Yes, my
excellent but fanciful friend will say, this is all very
well, but <i>if</i> there were such a case, what would you do?
Well, to speak for myself, I should prefer to wait till the
poor scholar's exchequer was in a more flourishing condition,
or why should I not take a turn at 'supposing'
myself? and perform the very easy trick of imagining
a more ripe scholar, a more enthusiastic student, endowed
not only with brains, but blessed with means to gratify
his whims, and then, without the least violence, I might
suppose the result to be a much more correct, a much
more critical edition than my friend's phantom scholar
could ever by any possibility concoct. But to return
to the region of reality; I answer that not even in<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
the case supposed, or in any case would I lend out
manuscripts, and this for more reasons than I have
patience to write down. One remark may, however, be
made. We are constantly requested to send manuscripts
abroad 'for collation,' and we not unfrequently send
them. Will any one be good enough to mention to
me a single collation of a Greek or Latin classic made
by any scholar by profession of any manuscript of fair
length&mdash;say, if you like, 300 pages of octavo print&mdash;which
is faithful, or which can be depended on? Even if it
were a defensible practice to send manuscripts abroad for
collation, it can never be a defensible practice to expose
them to all the risks they necessarily run, and after all
reap as a net result collations not worth the paper they
are written on.</p>

<p>I hope that these considerations may satisfy my imaginative
friend that there is not that force in his argument
which he supposes; but if he is still unconvinced, let
us agree to consider the case of the poor scholar when
it actually occurs on its merits, and let it be conceded
as a thing not impossible, that should all the supposed
conditions exist, we might for once in a way move Convocation
to lend a manuscript for the use of so singular
and so deserving a character; how does that justify us
in sending manuscripts abroad when no such conditions
exist? The most I have ever yet heard pleaded on behalf
of these foreign students was, not that they could not
afford to come to Oxford, but merely that it was much
more convenient to have a book sent out to Hungary or
Russia, than it was for the Hungarian or Russian to visit
us. I dare say it was more convenient to him, but it
has already been observed that he who wishes to use
public property must and ought to submit to not a few
personal inconveniences. It would, too, be interesting to
know whether, supposing any of us possessed a very
valuable book of our own, we should be ready and willing
to lend it as freely as we lend these books which are not
ours. I will answer for myself that I certainly should<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
not, and that it would be grossly inconsistent in me to
lend University property when I decline under precisely
similar circumstances to lend my own.</p>

<p>4. Again, it is argued that since foreign libraries are
willing to lend to us we ought to reciprocate their liberality:
we ought, it is said, to be as liberal as France or Germany
are. To the end of time men will be the dupes of
phrases and the slaves of words, yet it is a little strange
that we, who fancy ourselves in some respects raised
above the mob, should see any force in this singular perversion
of language. Who does not detect the hollow
and worthless nature of that 'liberality' which lends,
not what is its own, but what is another's? In what
possible sense, except an illusory and fallacious one, can
the Bodleian Curators credit themselves with the virtue of
'liberality' when they hand over, not their own property,
not anything which they collectively set great store on,
not anything which it would grieve them deeply to lose,
but something not their own? Such liberality seems to
me to be as cheap as it is worthless; as easy as it is
unreal. But, it will be objected, that the University empowers
them so to lend, and that it would be 'illiberal' in
them to accept loans from others and refuse themselves to
lend. As to the powers given by the University, I have
already said something; the rest of the plea may be
sufficiently answered by a single line from Hamlet&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Neither a borrower nor a lender be."<br />
</p>

<p>Sound, wholesome advice to all, whether taken as Polonius
intended it, or as I now use it. It would be mean and
shabby to borrow if you refuse to lend, for it would be
conniving at a vice which you decline to commit. Would
it not be more rational to argue that all lending out of
Bodleian books being bad, we therefore decline to benefit
(if benefit it be) by a practice which we disapprove of
in principle? To argue simply, as I have heard some do,
that because foreign libraries are willing to lend us books,
<i>therefore</i> we ought to be willing to lend them books, is,
as an argument, about as valid as it would be to say,<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
'My friend X has signified his willingness to lend me
his banjo, and therefore I am bound to lend him my
Erard's piano, if he asks for it': not every one would see
the force of such reasoning. If the lending of books from
such a library as the Bodleian be, as I maintain it is,
bad in principle, it can never become right because other
libraries are willing to be loose in their practice.</p>

<p>But suppose we look a little more closely into this
alleged 'liberality' of foreign countries, where lending
in some form or other is the rule rather than the exception.
And here let it be observed that 'library' though
one word covers things as different as chalk is from cheese.
Libraries differ not merely in quantity, in the number
of volumes which they contain: they also differ enormously
in quality and value. The University Library of G&ouml;ttingen
some forty years ago was estimated to contain
350,000 volumes. The Grenville Library (now part of
the British Museum) consists in round numbers of 20,000
volumes, each of which cost on an average <i>two pounds,
fourteen shillings</i>; and this small but most choice collection
would in the present day probably sell for a sum
almost sufficient to purchase the whole of the G&ouml;ttingen
350,000 volumes. The Bodleian is equalled and even
far surpassed in point of numbers by other libraries, but
for quality and real value there are not in all the world
a dozen that could, or by any competent person would,
be compared with it, and this fact makes all the difference
when lending is in question. You might lend and lose
half the books at G&ouml;ttingen, and still be able without
very much trouble or expense to replace them to the
satisfaction of that University. By losing a single half-dozen
of some of our Bodleian books, you might seriously
maim and cripple a large department; and as to replacing
the half-dozen, you might just as well try to replace the
coal in our coal pits. I have seen it stated that all the
great libraries of Europe lend, except the Vatican and
the British Museum: even Mr. Panizzi, forgetting for
the moment what he well knew, says, 'In all libraries on<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
the Continent they lend books, but here [i.e. at the
British Museum] I hope they will never lend them: it
is quite right not to lend them' (Report on British
Museum, 1850, p. 230). And even if all do lend (and
all do not), it would no more follow that they ought to
do so, than it follows that no man should do right,
because all men are sinners. Why are we to follow a
foreign fashion? Why are we to follow a multitude to
do evil? We are quite strong enough to act properly,
if we only had the infinitesimal amount of courage needful.
Even if it were true that every great library in Europe
does a foolish thing, why should we, with the true spirit
of slavish imitation, be equally foolish?</p>

<p>Amongst the libraries, which may be with more or less
justice compared with the Bodleian, are the National
Library of Paris; the British Museum; the Vatican;
the Royal Library of Munich; the Imperial Library of
St. Petersburg; the Imperial Library at Vienna; the
Ambrosian at Milan. Thirty odd years ago only <i>two</i>
of these ever lent a book, and then hardly in the sense
in which any one in Oxford would understand that phrase.
At this very moment, the British Museum, the second or
third largest and finest library in the world, does not
lend; the Vatican does not lend; the Ambrosian library,
great in printed books, greater in manuscripts, does not
lend; the Escurial, famed for its Arabic manuscripts, never
lends, not even within the limits of Spain; the Municipal
Library of Ravenna, a name well known to all students
of Aristophanes for its famous codex, never lends; nor
does the Angelica at Rome: and there are more libraries
of which this is true. Few, however, would believe till
they have tried the experiment, how difficult it is for
a private person to get really trustworthy information
as to the practices of foreign libraries.</p>

<p>Again, all foreign libraries that practise lending lend under
restrictions unknown to us in Oxford. At the Bodleian
there are no written rules at all, and, as far as I know,
there never have been any. The present Librarian rightly<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
felt that such a state of things ought not to be allowed;
he accordingly drew up a draft set of regulations; it
was at his request that the committee mentioned above,
p. 26, was appointed, and but for his sense of duty the
board would possibly never have perceived that rules were
requisite. The Italian government controls some 33 libraries,
and the rules for loans fill 83 paragraphs and 18 pages
quarto. Without the special leave of the Minister of
Instruction, no government librarian in Italy can lend manuscripts,
printed books of the 15th century, very rare
editions, books with autographs of celebrated men or with
important notes, books printed on vellum, books with
plates of much value, or the chief value of which consists
in the engravings, expensive works, works in many volumes,
coast surveys, maps, atlases, books finely bound or otherwise
valuable, old music. In other words, <i>no librarian
can lend any manuscript whatever, or any valuable printed
book, without special leave</i>. The restrictions on loans to
foreign countries are also numerous.</p>

<p>The National Library of Paris, the largest in the whole
world, also lends, but never in the wild fashion sanctioned
in this place. Here are the very words of the 'R&egrave;glement,'
Art. 115: 'Peuvent seuls &ecirc;tre pr&ecirc;t&eacute;s dans le d&eacute;partement
des imprim&eacute;s, les doubles qui ne font pas partie de la
r&eacute;serve, pourvu, en outre, qu'il ne s'agisse ni de livres
particuli&egrave;rement pr&eacute;cieux, ni de dictionnaires, ni de journaux,
ni de morceaux ou partitions de musique, ni de
volumes appartenant &agrave; de grandes collections ou contenant
des figures hors texte.</p>

<p>'Ne peuvent pas non plus &ecirc;tre pr&ecirc;t&eacute;s les romans, ni les
pi&egrave;ces du th&eacute;&acirc;tre moderne, ni les ouvrages de litt&eacute;rature
frivole. Le conservateur appr&eacute;cie en premier ressort les
circonstances qui permettent ou non de pr&ecirc;ter un livre.'</p>

<p>Art. 116: 'Peuvent seuls &ecirc;tre pr&ecirc;t&eacute;s dans le d&eacute;partement
des manuscrits, les volumes qui ne sont pas particuli&egrave;rement
pr&eacute;cieux par leur raret&eacute;, leur antiquit&eacute;, les autographes
ou les miniatures qu'ils contiennent, ou par toute autre circonstance
dont le conservateur est juge en premier ressort.'<span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>This library then <i>never lends anything but duplicates</i>,
and only such duplicates as are <i>not</i> part of the reserve,
i.e. part of the more valuable section of the library, and
not even such duplicates if they are specially valuable.</p>

<p>The libraries of Germany and Switzerland have rules
substantially the same as those adopted in France and
Italy; and it is the same with Belgium when they lend
at all. In the Biblioth&egrave;que Royale de Belgique, Art. 41
of the 'R&egrave;glement' runs thus: 'Dans la section des imprim&eacute;s,
les ouvrages d'un usage journalier, les livres rares,
de luxe ou &agrave; figures, les &eacute;ditions du XV^e si&egrave;cle, les livres
sur v&eacute;lin ou sur grand papier, ceux dont les reliures sont
pr&eacute;cieuses ou remarquables, les collections ou parties de
collection consid&eacute;rable <i>ne sont jamais pr&ecirc;t&eacute;s au dehors</i>.'</p>

<p>As to the Imperial Library of St. Petersburg, the
Director writes under date Dec. 11, 1886: 'la Biblioth&egrave;que
Imp&egrave;riale n'a pas le droit, d'apr&egrave;s la loi, de pr&ecirc;ter ses
manuscrits aux personnes particuli&egrave;res, que sur la demande
des autorit&eacute;s comp&egrave;tents, et pour les personnes hors des
limites de la Russie, que par l'entremise du minist&egrave;re
des affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res avec l'autorisation de Sa Majest&eacute;.
En m&ecirc;me temps je crois devoir ajouter, que les manuscrits
les plus pr&eacute;cieux ne sortent jamais de la Biblioth&egrave;que, dans
aucun cas, de m&ecirc;me que les codes dont s'occupent les
savants du pays.'</p>

<p>It would be impossible to do in any of these foreign
countries what is done in Oxford. Expensive illustrated
works are, as I have heard, had out of the library, and
are then used to illustrate lectures&mdash;a short and easy
method of bringing books to ruin.</p>

<p>To trust to discretion alone, whether it be the discretion
of a librarian or of a board, is to lean on a broken reed;
and in most foreign libraries that discovery has long since
been made: it is high time that we made it too, if we
are foolish enough to sanction the practice of lending.</p>

<p>When it is said then that <i>all</i> great foreign libraries
lend, let it always be remembered, in the first place,
that strictly speaking all do not lend; and, in the second<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
place, that those which lend restrict the practice in
a way never dreamt of here.</p>

<p>Such then are the arguments for lending: they may be
stated in other terms, and they may be indefinitely varied
in shape, but when reduced to their ultimate forms they
simply come to this&mdash;that by lending books out the utility
of the library is increased, the convenience of readers is
consulted, the progress of learning is facilitated, and international
courtesy is promoted&mdash;all very good things in
themselves and much to be desired, but, as always in
this world, we have to balance good with evil, and to
take that course which involves the least inconvenience
on the whole.</p>

<p>I confess that it rather depresses me to have to argue
the question at all, and if the <i>genius loci</i> affected all minds
as it affects mine, the very faintest suspicion of degrading
and vulgarising such an institution as the Bodleian would
be enough, and more than enough, to settle the matter;
and surely it is a degradation of that noble library to
look on it, as some seem to do, as a sort of enlarged
and diversified Mudie's. Our books may be all over
Oxford, nay, all over Europe; they may be in Germany,
in France, in India, in Russia, in London, at Cambridge,
and heaven only knows where. What is all this but the
first step towards turning the Bodleian into a vast and
vulgar circulating library? I must say again, as I have
said elsewhere, that the Bodleian Library is absolutely
unlike any other library in the world; it is in its way
peerless and unique; it was founded and augmented by
learned men for learned men; it was never meant for
the motley crew which in the present day crams the Camera
and the Library itself. It is sad to one who can remember
what the Bodleian was even thirty years ago to see such
rapid decline, such manifest tokens of disregard for all
that once rendered the place a sacred spot. But this is
to wander from my immediate business, and what I conceive
to be the abuse, I might even say the gross abuse of
the Bodleian, for which the Curators are directly responsible,
must be matter for some other paper.<span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>It seems to be the notion of some people in this University
that the Bodleian Library is a fit place for readers
of any and of every kind. They have not knowledge enough
of books or of libraries to see that a library suitable only
to scholars of a high class is not a library adapted to
learners and schoolboys.</p>

<p>Any one beginning microscopic work will find all, and
more than all, his wants satisfied for a long time to come
by a five guinea instrument, and he is not unlikely to
damage even that. Suppose that, instead of such an instrument,
you gave him at once a two hundred pound
microscope by Smith and Beck, or Ross, what would
happen? He would be utterly bewildered by the complexity
of it, utterly unable to use it as it should be
used, and he would most certainly before long so damage
it as to render it useless to all who could make a proper
use of it. Between a first-rate microscope by Ross and
a three or five guinea instrument the difference is much less
than is the difference between the Bodleian and a library
fit for undergraduates, or generally for the unlearned. By
introducing undergraduates, schoolboys, and girls into such
a library as the Bodleian, you in fact degrade the library
to base uses, and render it <i>pro tanto</i> inconvenient, to use
a very mild term, to all who are fit to benefit by it,
and who were intended by the founder to have the advantage
of it.</p>

<p>'What my experience has taught me,' says a most learned
bibliographer (1. R. 121)<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, 'is, that it ought never to be
attempted to use, as a popular library, the large libraries
intended in the first instance for a superior class of readers;'
and he adds further, that 'on every occasion, when it has
been tried, the greatest part of the riches accumulated
in the old library have been rendered useless.'</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Report from the Select Committee on Public Libraries, ordered by the
House of Commons to be printed 23 July, 1849, quoted by pages as 1. R.
A second volume ordered to be printed 1 August, 1850, is quoted also by
pages as 2. R. These Blue books contain an immense amount of information
on all the libraries of Europe, and although the information
is some forty years old, it is still indispensable to all who wish to acquaint
themselves with the subject. The evidence also given is of the most
varied kind, and very instructive.<span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p></div>

<p>If it is in any sense useful to lend books out of the
library, it is far more useful, all things considered, not
to lend them.</p>

<p>Every man of the least intelligence can see the difference
between a library of reference and one from which books
are lent. A library of reference, or a library of deposit,
is one where books are to be perpetually preserved as
carefully as may be for the convenience of scholars and
students, and for the promotion of sound and solid
learning; and lending any book from such a library is
obviously inconsistent with the very purpose for which
it is founded. 'I think,' says the Solicitor-General for
Scotland, speaking of the Advocates' Library, 'that (lending
books out) is quite inconsistent with the proper preservation
of a great library' (1. R. 95).<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> And another very able
witness, Mr. Colles, one of the library committee of the
Royal Dublin Society, gives it as the result of his experience
that no lending should be allowed in such a
library. 'I speak,' he says, 'against the interest of my
own family when I say this: but I think that the public
use of the library would be increased by not lending.'
And again, 'The two (i. e. libraries of reference and of
circulation) ought to be separated, just as banks of issue
should be separated from banks of deposit. I wish to
be understood on this point: an individual painter or
sculptor might be greatly benefited by borrowing out a
capital picture from the National Gallery, or the Torso,
Venus, or Portland Vase from the British Museum; but
such a loan would by no means benefit artists in general,
or advance the ultimate interests of painting or sculpture.
This holds good equally with regard to valuable books.'

<p>This question as to the expediency of lending books
out of such libraries as the British Museum or the
<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>Bodleian has been hotly debated both at home and abroad
for the last eighty years or more, and I wish I had
space to detail the arguments that have been used, not by
men ignorant of books and eager only to consult their own
convenience, or to obtain credit for a spurious liberality;
but by those who really and truly knew all the ins and
outs of the matter they were talking about, and who were
quite as anxious to promote learning as we are ourselves.
Take, for instance, the late Mr. Thomas Watts, keeper of
printed books in the British Museum, one of the very rarest
of men, a librarian who thoroughly knew his business, at
all events so far as printed books were concerned, and
quite unequalled as regards all questions of organisation
and administration. He carries impartiality almost to
excess, for he says, speaking of lending, 'It would, perhaps,
be expedient to examine the subject more closely before
a final determination was come to on either side; for
while the Bodleian Library is strictly non-circulating,
the books are freely lent out to the members of the
University from the University Library of Cambridge,
and yet any material difference in the condition of the
two libraries to the disadvantage of that of Cambridge,
is certainly not a matter of public notoriety.' This
statement appeared in 1867, and Mr. Watts evidently
did not know that lending had been practised by the
Bodleian Curators ever since 1862 (see above, p. 14);
nor was he seemingly aware of the facts detailed by
Mr. Bradshaw, or of such gross abuses as that which Mr.
Bradshaw told a friend of my own. He said that on a
certain occasion a graduate had a dinner party, and that
he borrowed from the University Library certain expensive
illustrated works to be laid on the table to amuse his
guests; Bradshaw was powerless, though indignant at an
act so disgraceful. Carefully however as Mr. Watts holds
the balance, it seems unquestionable that he himself
condemned the practice of lending from such libraries as
the British Museum or the Bodleian; for after writing a
column or more, in which he shows every disposition to<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
lend books where it is possible to do so without causing
more harm than good, he considers Mr. Spedding's proposal
to lend a book wanted by a reader in London to the British
Museum library&mdash;the very thing in fact which we now
are in the habit of doing, he then says; "By this ingenious
arrangement some of the advantages proposed by
the lending system would certainly be afforded, under
safeguards not now obtainable; but there would still remain
the strong objection that a reader wishing to examine
a particular book known to be in a particular library
might be subjected to a disappointment which he is now
in no hazard of. This objection is tersely stated in a
passage from a letter by Niebuhr, which was quoted by
the Commissioners for examining into the University of
Oxford. 'It is lamentable,' writes Niebuhr from the
University of Bonn, 'that I am here much worse off
for books than I was at Rome, where I was sure to find
whatever was in the library, because no books were lent
out; here I find that just the book which I most want
is always lent out.' There are few libraries from which
books are lent of which stories are not current respecting
the abuse of the privilege, of volumes kept for years by
persons too high or too venerable to be questioned. The
rules of such institutions are often laxly observed by
those from whom we should least expect such disregard.
In Walter Scott's correspondence with Southey there is a
passage in which he recommends him not to show publicly
a book which he had sent him, because it belongs to
the Advocate's Library, and it is forbidden for those books
to be sent out of Scotland."</p>

<p>The opinion then of one of the most accomplished
librarians that ever lived is, on the whole, adverse to the
system of lending. I believe it to be quite impossible
for a man of his enormous knowledge of the subject
to come to any other conclusion than that at which he
arrived: the less a man knows about books and libraries,
the more inclined he is to the pernicious system of lending;
the more he knows about them, the less inclined<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
he is to countenance anything of the kind; such at least
has been my experience.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Henry Bradshaw of Cambridge was a
most learned librarian and an accomplished bibliographer.
He has not, so far as I am aware, expressed in print his
plain opinion of the lending system; but no one can read
his paper on the Cambridge University Library, (The
University Library, ... by Henry Bradshaw, Librarian of
the University, Camb. 1881. 8vo.,) without seeing that he
bitterly regretted the practice which prevails and has long
prevailed in that place. The Bodleian has a history, a
noble and honourable history: the Cambridge University
Library has none, at all events none that is not disgraceful.
'One reason,' he says (p. 6), 'for the dearth of materials in
the Library for its own history is to be found in the circumstance
that the Library is really scattered over the
whole country.' And again, 'We have often heard of the
principal benefactors to the Bodleian Library having been
induced to bequeath their own libraries to the University
of Oxford from seeing the careful way in which the
bequests of their predecessors have been housed and kept
together. The coincidence at Cambridge is too striking to
be accidental, where we find that only two such bequests
are on record': this statement he subsequently corrects
into 'three' instead of two: and again, 'It is probable that
by drawing attention to the fact that none of the great
collectors of the last two hundred years have thought fit
to leave their books to our University Library, we may be
pointing to a lesson which our successors may profit by,
even though we are too indifferent to pay any attention to
it ourselves.'</p>

<p>The inference plainly to be drawn from these and
other passages is that the writer strongly disapproved
of the practice which he was obliged officially to countenance.
From 1600 down to the last ten or fifteen
years the history of the Bodleian Library has been on
the whole a history of which every true scholar, and
every genuine lover of books may be proud; the history<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
of the Cambridge Library for the corresponding period has
been an almost unbroken record of disgraceful carelessness,
and the root of all the evil has been the practice of
lending, as will be clear to any one who will take the
trouble to read Mr. Bradshaw's paper. There has been,
as there always must be, where such a practice is allowed,
wholesale robbery. In 1772 the library was inspected
and 'a large number of rare books were reported to be
missing.' (p. 28.) The latest previous inspection had
been in 1748, when 902 volumes were reported as missing
from the old library alone ... the loss was the result
of that wholesale pillage spoken of before. It is very
singular that the very same year that the inspection shewed
such serious losses to have happened from unrestricted
access, the University should have made fresh orders
(the basis of those now in use), permitting more fully this
same freedom of access. The <i>Cicero de Officiis</i> printed
in 1465 on vellum, a Salisbury Breviary printed in 1483
on vellum (the only known copy of the first edition),
the Salisbury <i>Directorium Sacerdotum</i> printed by Caxton
(the only known copy), are three instances out of many
scores of such books which might be mentioned as purloined
during the latter half of the eighteenth century,
simply from this total disregard of all care for the preservation
of the books. Even manuscripts were lent out
on ordinary tickets; and it was seemingly only owing to
the strong remonstrances of Mr. Kerrich, the principal
Librarian of the day, that a grace was passed in 1809,
requiring that no manuscript whatever should be borrowed,
except with the permission of the Senate, and on
a bond given for the same to the Librarian. "We have
the ticket, but we cannot get the book back," Mr. Kerrich
says: "and to this day the book in question has never
been returned." (p. 28.) Such are the disgraceful acts
of men bred at an English University, compared with whom
the common pickpocket appears positively respectable.</p>

<p>Mr. Panizzi, principal Librarian of the British Museum,
a man whose knowledge of libraries and of books has<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
rarely been equalled, was asked, 'Are you of opinion
that there should be in all countries libraries of two sorts,
namely, libraries of deposit, and libraries devoted to general
reading and the circulation of books?' answered, 'That
is another question. I think the question of lending books
is a very difficult question to answer. I have enquired
in all countries, and, as far as experience goes, I find that,
in spite of all the precautions taken, of the regulations,
and of everything which is done, books disappear; they
are stolen or spoiled.' (2. R. 62.) And again: 'I do
not think that lending can well be adopted without
great risk of losing books; the question is whether there
might not be remedies; I think from all experience
I never found that librarians had succeeded in preventing
stealing.' He also tells a very instructive story of some
rare books stolen from the library at Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, and
be it noted that Panizzi and Watts knew more of their
profession than a whole army of ordinary librarians. Let
no one fancy for one moment that a congress of librarians
is necessarily a congress of men really acquainted with
either bibliography or with books; it may, perhaps, on
some occasions include one or more who answer to that
description, but in general it does not do so. 'La bibliographie,'
says Richou, 'est une science exacte qui demande
une pr&eacute;paration assez longue et que la pratique d&eacute;veloppe.
Les biblioth&eacute;caires improvis&eacute;s en ignorent jusqu'&agrave; l'existence
et se pr&eacute;occupent peu de l'acqu&eacute;rir. Il ne faut
pas chercher ailleurs la cause de la mauvaise administration
d'un grand nombre de biblioth&egrave;ques publiques, car le
mal est commun.' (<i>Trait&eacute; de l'Administration des Biblioth&egrave;ques
publiques</i>, p. 82.)</p>

<p>The opinion expressed by Mr. Watts and Mr. Panizzi,
and implied by Mr. Bradshaw, is, I am convinced, the
opinion of all men who are acquainted with this question
in its length, breadth, and depth.</p>

<p>How comes it then, some one may ask, that foreign
librarians do not speak out against the practice? Because
it is not in general the habit of foreign officials to have<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
opinions of their own, and still less to express them, if
they have them, when such opinions are not fashionable,
or not likely to advance those who utter them: and this
goes a long way towards explaining the answers given to
questions put by the English Government nearly forty
years ago to the custodians of libraries where (though
under many restrictions) lending was, and is practised.
The general tenor of the answers is that books do not
suffer more than might be expected, that losses are comparatively
rare, that when loss is suffered the books can
generally be replaced, and that when they cannot their
value can almost always be recovered from the borrower.
Such, I say, is the general tenor of the answers, but few
who know anything about circulating libraries will accept
such answers as satisfactory. Before the outbreak of the
Thirty Years' War the Germans printed splendid books,
and not unfrequently bound them grandly; but for the
last two hundred years few German librarians, unless
trained in France or England, have known what a really
fine book is, or whether it is in what a Frenchman would
call good condition. In other words, when they say that
books lent are not much damaged, it must be always
remembered that notions of damage are relative, and
most German librarians are in all probability like an
old friend of my own, who holds that no book is in
really ill condition, provided the readable part of it is
still legible: the title may be torn or gone; 'I don't
want to read the title,' says he: the covers may be broken
or destroyed; 'Cannot you read an unbound book?' he
asks; and so on. There is this difference, however; my
friend does know when a book really is in good condition.
Moreover, there are, or at least there were, some foreign
librarians who have dared to tell the truth. Thus (see
2. R. 161-171), from the returns made by eighteen
libraries in Belgium, we learn that the library of Antwerp
(19,148 vols.) never lent; that no manuscripts were ever
lent from that of Bruges; that manuscripts and rare books
were never lent from the library of Malines; that valuable<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
books were never lent from the library of Louvain; that
no manuscripts or valuable books were ever lent from
the library of Mons; and that such books and manuscripts
were never lent from any of the University libraries.
Nevertheless, some lending there was from some libraries;
and it was asserted that little damage was done the books.
Very different is the answer of the Librarian of Tournay
(2. R. 163): 'Cette coutume a des inconv&eacute;nients assez
graves: impossibilit&eacute; pour certains lecteurs de consulter
les ouvrages dont ils ont besoin: rentr&eacute; tardive des livres
pr&ecirc;t&eacute;s; perte ou d&eacute;t&eacute;rioration des volumes.' The Librarian
of Nassau (2. R. 299), very unlike most of his brethren, says,
'das Verleihen der B&uuml;cher asserhalb der Anstalt hat
allerdings die nachtheilige Folge dass dieselben in kurzer
Zeit, im Aussern wie im Innern stark mitgenommen
werden. Die Einb&auml;nde werden verstossen und sch&auml;big
und der Druck durch Schnupfer und Raucher oft aufs
Unangenehmste beschmutzt,' with more to the same effect.
Even at the Royal Library of Berlin it is admitted that
'die B&uuml;cher und Einb&auml;nde werden dadurch mehr besch&auml;dight
und verdorben' (2. R. 304); and at the University
Library, 'die Abnutzung durch die Studirenden ist sehr
stark' (2. R. 305). The answer from the University
Library at Bonn is, 'Nachtheilige Folge beim Verleihen
der B&uuml;cher waren troz der sorgf&auml;ltigsten Ueberwachung
nicht immer zu vermeiden. Manche B&auml;nde kamen beschmutzt
auch verst&uuml;mmelt zur&uuml;ck.' There are very similar
answers from a few other libraries both of Germany and
Italy. Common sense and a little experience will tell any
one to which class of testimony credence should be given.</p>

<p>As to replacing a lost or damaged book, the thing is
by no means so easy as it looks. What is common to-day
may be rare a year hence, and quite unprocurable on any
terms in two years time. 'Then,' says Ignoramus, 'it will
be reprinted, and you may buy that'; but the man who
talks so wildly cannot be argued with, because he does
not know the elements of the subject of which he is
speaking. Suppose you lose the 19th edition of the<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
<i>Christian Year</i>, you do not replace the book by purchasing
the 100th edition, as all experts know. 'Buy another
copy of the 19th then', says Ignoramus; but it may be
that you have to pay a very high price for it, and it
sometimes happens that you cannot get it at all. 'If you
do not get the book, you can recover its value.' Even
supposing that you can&mdash;and here in Oxford we have no
machinery by which we can recover a farthing&mdash;how is
a man who wants to see a particular book benefited by
being told that he cannot see the book because it has
been lent and lost, but that the Library has received
compensation? Well might Panizzi say that the question
of lending is a very difficult question; it is so difficult
that a volume would hardly contain an enumeration of
all its complexities.</p>

<p>Consider the case of books, printed and manuscript, lent
out to those on the borrowers' list, a list, be it observed,
which, according to the lawyers, has not the least statutable
warrant. In the first place, you have not the least assurance
or guarantee that any one of them knows how to use a
book without damaging it, and, as I have already said,
it is an almost uniform and invariable experience, that
borrowers of books do damage them. All book-lovers
know this so well, that they make very sure of their
man before they intrust a valuable or well-bound book
to him, but we at the Bodleian do not. Pixer&eacute;court, a
great collector, was so convinced of this fact that he
inscribed over his library door these sadly true lines&mdash;</p>

<p>
Tel est le triste sort de tout livre pr&ecirc;t&eacute;<br />
Souvent il est perdu, toujours il est g&acirc;t&eacute;.<br />
</p>

<p>How unfit some at least on the borrowers' list are to
be intrusted with books, how little notion they have of
taking care of them, is clear from many facts which might
be mentioned. In the library itself you may see almost
any day abundant proof of the unfitness of those admitted
to enjoy the privileges which are allowed them. On
May 19th, 1885, a Curator came into my room and said,
<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>'I was walking through the Bodleian looking for &mdash;&mdash;
when I saw a sight which made me sick.' 'You may see
many such sights there,' said I; 'what was it?' 'I saw
a bevy of women with an illuminated MS., and they
were turning over the leaves, all looking at it.' On
Friday, August 21st, 1885, I myself counted at one desk
at the Selden end <i>sixty-four</i> volumes, all had out by one
reader; on the table was a MS. open, and on it two or
three books; another was open on the floor, and so on.
On April 22nd, 1886, I saw on a desk also at the Selden
end three (I believe four) Sanscrit MSS. They were
open and kept so by books placed on them, sundry
printed books also open one on the other, and in my
note written the same day I find the observation that it
was 'a miserable spectacle of untidiness and reckless disregard
for precious volumes.' It would be easy to add
more, for from the first I have kept notes of all that
I see in the library, and of much that I hear about it&mdash;this,
however, is enough to show what may be expected
when people carry off books home. There no prying eye
will see them, no one is likely to come suddenly round
a corner and observe their proceedings. Things are really
bad enough <i>in</i> the library as it is; and they are as bad
or worse in the Camera, where books are most shamefully
ill-used. I have notes of some things which I have
observed there, and of a conversation which I had with a
person of sharp eyes and wits. One Curator alone can do
very little; if all would, even it were only occasionally, do
what I do habitually (Tit. XX. iii. &sect; 12, 2), it would be
far easier than it now is to put a stop to some rather
serious abuses. Let it be distinctly understood that in
saying all this I do not blame any person or persons
whatever, except the readers. In the British Museum
Reading-room a man placed where the officials sit could,
with a machine-gun, comfortably pick off every reader
in less than a minute, because he could rake every desk;
the Bodleian is so picturesque and so peculiar in its
construction, that Argus himself would be completely
non-plussed, if ordered to keep his eyes on the readers,<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
for even this highly-endowed being had not the dragon-fly
power of seeing round corners; and from the Librarian's
seat you might discharge a Gatling gun straight up 'Duke
Humphrey,' with no other result than the downfall of
a little dust, and the smashing of the west window; as
to hitting a reader, you might as well try to shoot the
Invisible Girl. At the Camera there is just the same
difficulty, which will hardly be overcome till the laws
of nature are reformed, and light condescends to travel
in convenient curves. The regular officials have quite
enough to do, if they attend only to their necessary work,
which pins them down to one spot, and totally precludes
them from exercising (even if they possessed it) the saintly
privilege of bilocation. To come back to the point:
books are badly used in the library itself. Now I ask
any man of common sense, whether it is possible that
books treated so vilely in the library itself will be better
treated in a private house?</p>

<p>I am not going to tell any tales, but this I may say,
that before I became a Curator I have seen Bodleian
books (once a very rare book) in strange places, and
under circumstances by no means conducive to their preservation.
The thing must be so: it is as much as
the most vigilant officer can do to prevent damage being
done under his very eyes, and it stands to reason that no
mercy will be shown a book as soon as it is fairly out of
the building.</p>

<p>Again, when a man borrows a book from the Bodleian,
you have not the least assurance that he will not in his
turn lend it. This I know has happened with one book
at least belonging to another library in Oxford. Sir
Walter Scott had, perhaps, as much conscience as it is
possible for a literary man to have, yet he lends Southey
a book borrowed from the Advocates' Library (see above,
p. 49) contrary to rule; and what Scott would do, Scott's
inferior in character and morals would most certainly not
scruple to do.</p>

<p>When a book is lent out to any one on the borrowers'<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
list no contract is entered into, either verbally or in writing,
that the book shall be returned at any specified time,
nor in fact that it shall ever be returned at all. Are
the Curators quite sure that they have any legal power
to compel a return under such circumstances?</p>

<p>Unless a book is carefully collated when it is returned,
it will always be impossible to say with truth that it
has been returned intact; and if every book is to be
collated on its restoration to the library, we shall have
no small increase of work, and increase of work always
means, as we well know, increased expense.</p>

<p>The lending of books to private houses then involves
the very probable, and in many cases the absolutely certain,
damage of the book, and its possible total loss without
the least remedy, and without the slightest recompense or
penalty. A manuscript was lent to the late Professor
----, and it is hardly necessary to say that it has never
been returned, and this is, I fancy, at least the second
instance within a very few years of total loss, for which
neither the public nor the University ever received one
atom of benefit.</p>

<p>Even if the Bodleian were not one of the two great
reference libraries of this country, if it were merely a
large and fine library of no very great national importance,
there would still be no excuse for borrowing from it; for
there is no town of its size that contains so many books
as Oxford. In every College there is a library, which is
not unfrequently full of fine books&mdash;Christ Church, All
Souls', St. John's, Worcester, Merton, Corpus, Oriel,
Magdalen and Queen's are all remarkable; and if we count
in manuscripts there is hardly a single College without
its gems and rarities. Nor is there the slightest difficulty
in making a proper use of all these treasures. Any one
really fit to use a College book is always permitted to
do so, nor is there in general any objection to lending
if the borrower is known to be trustworthy: the fault,
if any, is rather the other way. 'But,' says some borrower,
'the book that I want is in no College library, and it is<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
in the Bodleian.' Is it not plain to every man of sense,
that the book which is in no College library, and is in
the Bodleian, is just the book which ought not to be
lent, under any conceivable circumstances? Lending even
from College libraries has been the cause of innumerable
losses&mdash;in fact, nothing in Euclid is more true than the
proposition, that sooner or later <span class="smcap">A BOOK LENT IS A BOOK
LOST</span>.</p>

<p>Of the losses which the library at Cambridge has
sustained, something has been said above (p. 51). All
libraries, however carefully kept, are exposed to occasional
and exceptional depredations. Paulus, the celebrated
German professor, stole one manuscript at least from the
Bodleian; the thefts in German, Russian, Italian, and
French libraries are only too notorious. Are we to give
additional facilities by lending books out? Even when
lent to the greatest scholars, and presumably to careful
men, books are by no means safe. Every one knows
how, not so long ago, two or more of the most ancient
manuscripts of Jornandes were destroyed while in the
hands of Mommsen. Fire invaded his rooms; the professor
escaped unharmed (of course he did), but the manuscripts
were destroyed. Literature and scholarship gained nothing
by this loan, though all future generations have lost
much. Had common sense been the ruling principle of
the libraries from which Mommsen obtained these manuscripts,
they would have been safe at this moment. The
convenience, perhaps the laziness, of an individual was
consulted, and the world has lost what can never be
replaced.</p>

<p>Mr. Watts, whom I have already quoted, says in speaking
of lending, 'The testimony of Molbech, the librarian of
the Royal Library of Copenhagen, where lending is permitted,
is to the effect, not only that the risk is greater,
as must of course be the case where books are removed
from supervision and control, but that in practice great
damage is found to ensue.' If we are told, as very likely
we shall be told, that no such damage occurs here, I am<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
somewhat at a loss to answer; perhaps it will be enough
to observe that different men unavoidably have different
ideas of what constitutes damage, and that what is not
always immediately discovered may hereafter be detected
when it is too late to assign the blame to the real offender.</p>

<p>Under the present system of administration, for which
the Curators are responsible, the actual, and, it may be,
the unavoidable wear and tear of books in the library
itself, even in the choicer portions of it, is great enough
to deter any man in the future from acting as Douce
did in the past. The way in which very precious volumes
are knocked about is plain enough to any one who visits
the interior of the library as constantly as I do, and as
all Curators are by statute empowered and even ordered
to do. Readers are impatient, sometimes unreasonable;
immense numbers of books can only be reached by means
of ladders; the whole establishment is undermanned, and
though the small staff does its best to protect the books,
they are notwithstanding much bumped about. One consequence
of this rough usage is that the standard of carefulness,
as it may be called, is very naturally lowered, and
as a further consequence the estimate of what constitutes
damage is lowered in proportion.</p>

<p>There are many readers, or there certainly have been
readers in the library, who have not hesitated to make marks
in printed books and manuscripts. The man who will do
such a thing as this in the library, will not hesitate to
do it when he gets the book into his own possession.
Now all avoidable wear and tear is so much real loss to
the library, and detracts in that proportion from its utility.
It may be useful to A or B to borrow books from the
Bodleian, but it cannot be useful to the University or to
future generations that the life of any book should be
carelessly or needlessly abridged.</p>

<p>It will be admitted that no book can be in two places
at the same time; if a volume is in the rooms of Mr. X
or Mr. Y, it cannot at that moment be produced in the
Bodleian should a reader happen to want it. One of<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
the great advantages of such a library as the Bodleian,
if it were properly administered, is that a visitor is sure to
find the book which he comes to consult. This is perfectly
well understood by such men as Mr. Watts (see above,
p. 49); it was brought home to the mind of Niebuhr,
and it has been one of the reasons why all lending has
up to the present moment been most rigidly forbidden at
the British Museum. In a library like the Bodleian,
where the practice of lending prevails as it now does, a
man may put himself to great inconvenience in order to
visit it; he may even travel from Berlin, and when he
arrives he may find that all his trouble has been in vain;
the very book he wants is out: at the British Museum,
where up to the present time knowledge and common
sense have prevailed, every man is sure that he can at
once get any book whatever that he finds in the catalogue.
It is a thousand pities to destroy this confidence; one of
the great uses of a library like ours disappears when
things are so ill managed, and I believe that there are
in the Bodleian men who could tell of some grievous disappointments
caused by our modern laxity. I know very
well that we shall be told that such cases are few and
trivial: be it so. Who does not see that as the present
practice extends, as extend it must, one of the great
advantages of a grand library will at last vanish? Nothing
can be more strictly useful to all real students than the
absolute certainty of obtaining at once any book that
can be found in the catalogue.</p>

<p>No limit seems to be placed on the borrower's powers;
he may, for anything that appears to the contrary, have
any number of books or manuscripts out. Now when
we see the practice of more than one reader <i>in</i> the library,
we may form a pretty shrewd guess of what men will
do in the way of borrowing. I am well within the mark
when I say that at least <i>one hundred</i> volumes have been
ere now allowed out to one reader at a time.</p>

<p>The present Librarian has been trying, I believe, to
check this morbid appetite for superfluous volumes; but
it is not always an easy thing to root out a bad habit.<span class="pagenum">[62]</span></p>

<p>Any one who examines the slips in the various parts
of the Bodleian, as I habitually do, will be struck by two
things; the immense number of volumes had out by the
same reader or readers, and the length of time that volumes
are allowed to remain off the shelves; and this is in
great measure the fault of a system for which we are
answerable. What takes place in the library will undoubtedly
sooner or later take place out of it. A borrower
is not, so far as I know, limited as to the number of
volumes he may have out; neither is he limited as to
the time he may keep them out. The present Librarian
informed me that when he came into office he found
that one book had been out of the library for <i>nine</i> years,
and that others had been off the shelves for very long
periods of time. And such things must happen, if you
sanction this wretched system of lending. It is perfectly
easy to do what constant experience has shown to entail
on the whole the minimum of evil; it is easy to keep
your books within the library as they do at the British
Museum; but if you once lend, there is no drawing of
lines possible. Altogether there are about one hundred
and eleven persons on the borrowers' list already. It is
said that the Curators can refuse any application if they
choose; of course they can, but as a matter of fact no
application ever has been refused, and every name
added will make it more and more difficult, more and
more invidious to refuse any one. Every Oxford resident
is potentially on the list, and he may be actually on it
whenever he likes. What is this but the beginning, and
something more than the beginning, of that wretched
system which Mr. Bradshaw speaks of above? (p. 50.)
The dissolution of our magnificent library is already insidiously
begun; and why is all this gratuitous and
irreparable mischief to be done? why is that vast storehouse
intended for the use and benefit of generation after
generation of scholars to be scattered and at last destroyed?
Simply to gratify the vulgar, selfish convenience of this
or that individual regardless of the general good. The<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
whole is to be sacrificed for a part, and for what a part!
The present Librarian has been trying to do something
to check this disastrous and ruinous practice, but the
Curators are responsible for it, not the Librarian.</p>

<p>Manuscripts and printed books when lent out of Oxford
are as a rule not lent to private houses but deposited in
some library. What happens abroad I do not know, though
I confess to having my suspicions. If a manuscript were
lent to some one in a Cathedral town, it would be deposited
in the Cathedral library; and we comfort ourselves with
the belief that in such a place it would be secure, and that
it would not on any account be removed from that library
elsewhere. An acquaintance of my own, a very safe man,
has had a Bodleian manuscript of great value out for some
years, and it is lent not to him directly, but to a library
where alone he is to use it. It may be that this arrangement
is actually carried out, and I do not know that it is not,
yet I would bet five pounds to a penny that if I went
to his house I should find the Bodleian book kicking about
in his study, where, in fact, though exposed to a thousand
risks of damage and even destruction, it is really safer than
in the library where we suppose it to be. For one Cathedral
library I can answer: a book would hardly be safer there
than it would be on a public and unwatched book-stall,
and such I have no doubt whatever is the case with more
than half the places to which we send books for safe custody.
There is as little conscience about books in this stupid
and wicked world as there is about umbrellas, and one of
the most important and most useful functions of a body
like the Curators of the Bodleian is to set up a high
standard in such matters. It is our duty as trustees to
take lofty ground, and to be sensitive where the world is
listless and careless; and even if we do not really feel
exactly as we ought, we are bound, like Gertrude, to
'assume a virtue though we have it not'; it is very
laudable hypocrisy if the real article cannot be had. Yet
I hope that it can, and that upon consideration we may
all see that the convenience of a few is not for a moment<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
to be compared with the convenience of many, and that
we shall awake to the fact that we, of all people, ought
not to countenance in any way whatever any practice
which may tend in the remotest degree to damage the
only institution in Oxford of which any rational being
can in the present day be justly proud.</p>

<p>Lending of books has many more evil consequences,
proximate and remote, than I have enumerated; but there
is one which at the risk of being tedious must be mentioned.
The glorious part of the Bodleian, the part contributed
by Bodley himself, by Laud, by Selden, Pembroke,
Digby, Roe, Rawlinson, &amp;c., consists largely of gifts. Every
man who knows anything at all about books, every one
who loves them, is perfectly well aware that very few
men will bequeath their libraries to an institution which
emulates the American or the English circulating and
commercial establishment. Barlow knew this, Bradshaw
knew it (see above, p. 50); every one knows it, who has
the least acquaintance with the habits and peculiarities
of collectors. The Bodleian has to my certain knowledge
already lost very rare books indeed which it might have
had, but for this penny-wise and pound-foolish policy.
Neither Rawlinson nor Douce would ever have been such
fools as to leave us what they did, could they have foreseen
how little sense of our duties and of our interests
we have shown. Bodley over and over again, and in the
strongest terms, forbad the lending of his books; Selden's
executors only delivered his books to us on the express
condition that they never should under any circumstances
be lent; Laud stipulated that his books should not be
lent, except for one particular purpose and in one particular
way. The Bodleian is what it is, because till
quite recent times we adhered to the rule of common
sense, not to say to that of common honesty, and it is
ever to be regretted that we departed from a course
which was at once safe and honourable. There will
be no more Douces, no more Rawlinsons, until we have
returned to better ways and proved the sincerity of our<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
repentance. I have heard it maintained that the days
of great benefactors are over, that in some way not
explained men's characters and habits have changed. I
cannot admit this; men are now what they always were,
and collectors in all ages are singularly alike. Only let
us be as prudent, as worldly wise, and, I will add, as
honest as our predecessors were, and there is no reason
why the munificent benefactors of the past should not
be rivalled by equally munificent benefactors in the future.
Mr. Bradshaw (above, p. 50) is decidedly of opinion that
carelessness with regard to books prevents benefactions,
and that care attracts them. Barlow is of the same mind,
and indeed the thing is too obvious to be insisted on.
It is only those who know little or nothing of the feelings
which actuate the real lovers of books who doubt about
such very simple facts as these.</p>

<p>To conclude this part of the subject; the arguments
against the lending of books out of such a library as
the Bodleian may be briefly summed up thus: lending
is bad, because books are necessarily exposed to needless
and certain risks of damage and of downright loss; because
one of the great ends served by a large library is defeated,
in that no man can be certain of obtaining a book known
to be in it; because lending leads sooner or later to the
destruction of a library; because it dries up the great
sources from which large numbers of the most valuable
books are derived; because it is disapproved of by all
those who have the largest and widest experience of books
and their management; because, finally, it is in violation
of the express directions of Bodley, of Selden, of Laud
and others, and almost certainly contrary to the wishes
of all our great benefactors, even though they may not
have said as much. Reason and authority are equally
against it; and the cause of learning and of literature
can never be permanently served by a practice which tends
to destroy that without which learning and literature alike
are impossible: whatever advantages may seem to attend
it, are more than counterbalanced by disadvantages so<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
great, that none but those who recklessly sacrifice the
future to the present, the interests of generations yet to
come, to the selfishness of the generation that now is,
can regard it with any favour or even with common
patience. We have by the sturdy honesty of our predecessors
received a vast treasure which they carefully
preserved intact; we are its guardians and trustees, and
we are bound in honour and honesty to hand on to our
successors, undiminished and unimpaired, what we have
received only as a trust, not as a something which we
may spend or destroy at our pleasure. Any wilful act
of ours which tends, however remotely, to damage the
Bodleian Library is not only a scandalous breach of duty,
but a crime against learning itself, in which I for one will
have no part or share.</p>

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
